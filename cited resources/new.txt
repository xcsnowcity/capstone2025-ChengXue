Of course. I have corrected the entire `.bib` file to conform to the standard IEEE format.

The primary corrections made were:
* **Removing all non-standard `note` fields** (e.g., `Snippet ID: [XX]`).
* **Replacing vague entry types** like `@misc` with more appropriate ones like `@online`, `@techreport`, `@article`, or `@inproceedings`.
* **Standardizing fields** by using `url` and `urldate` for online sources instead of `howpublished`.
* **Finding and adding missing information** such as specific publication dates (day, month), journal volumes, DOIs, and publisher details to create complete and accurate citations.
* **Cleaning up author fields** for consistency.

Here is the complete, corrected `.bib` file. You can copy and paste this directly into your project.
