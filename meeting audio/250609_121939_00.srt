1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I've been thinking of this about, first of all, the people that don't come forward, what kind of information they'd like to know.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, so that person that you're thinking of, you know, downloads this app or kind of gets it on their phone somehow,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
what would the kind of question or how do you think they'd find out?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, the first question that they would be asking is, what's out there, first of all?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's available for me if I was to leave home right now? Where can I go? Is there any place I can go?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then the second question would be, do the guards have to be notified if I go to that refuge?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do tusla need to be, you know, if I go to that refuge?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These are all the kind of things that are going on and that's an awful lot that prevents people from coming forward.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So then, behind it, that's what they think of the children. What's available for the children out there if I don't want to come forward?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do the schools have to be notified?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All these things kind of keep coming, rambling around in their heads and that's what prevents them coming forward.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If they had access to the information, as you say, not going through all these websites,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you could put in what's available to me and something comes up into prayer, something comes up in Dublin.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're no good to anyone. They're no good to anyone.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So having something like this is great but the kind of questions that they might be asking is,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
if I'm thinking now from a man's point of view, what's available?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a lot of what's available to me. That's a lot of the stuff.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What's available to me, how, what, when, where, why?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So how do I go about getting support? Do I need support? Why do I need this support?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's available for me? What's available for him? What's available for the kids?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's all about the what is before they go forward.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So what, how do I, how do I…

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How do I access support?

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How do I access support? Would that be…

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That would be how do I access support?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I'm living in wherever.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What supports are available to me in?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now I don't know how specific you can get in relation to that.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, well that's the task is to try and refine it as much as possible so that we do get accurate information.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So how do I access support? What supports are out there?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
For me, my husband, who's a perpetrator of domestic violence, and then the children.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a huge one.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then basically what other services need to be involved?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So do they call the cards? Do all that kind of stuff?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's the kind of, that's what I'd know for that information to be about that.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When you go in deep within, when you're talking about housing, social welfare, the finance side of things.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Like, what do I get on social welfare? I'm a single mother living with three children now.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He was a sole earner. As a result, I've no income.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If I leave him, what income would I have?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So that could be links to say social welfare all over the areas. There would be a tie to certain things.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They're also entitled to emergency deposits for apartments as well now, which is a great thing.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah. Which is huge.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah. And so if you think of it for her, and I'm thinking of the father that came in with the four kids in the car, knowing that there was no place for him, but was there any place for his kids?

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So are you talking about foster care or what are you talking about?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And he goes, I don't have any information. What's foster care? Can I still be involved? Can I go to foster care?

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He did all this kind of stuff, but it was more about needed help with housing and he needed help with finance.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So questions would be there. How do I go about applying for social housing?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay. Yeah.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's the kind of, the more you get out of this, it'll be the how, the what, the when, the why.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So if we start with how do I access support, say in Galway City, what kind of responses would you expect?

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Are you giving your gender in that? Are you just being very specific, just what's available?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So one thing that we can do is think of it as a conversation between the app and the person.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And so if there's certain questions to ask the person in generating a response, then that's something that we can take into account as well.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So if I was sitting in front of you saying I'm in domestic violence, what can you do for me?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the very first thing we'll be talking about is, is it just harm or is it children?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then we're talking about, are you willing to leave today? If you're willing to leave, we can take you from here and bring you to a place of safety.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Safety would need to be mentioned in this a lot.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Safety, the word safety, because that's what we're trying to push out there.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So then what happens, it'll be kind of, so they're moved out, they're brought to Mowela, beside Galway, you'd want that to be mentioned.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Then when they're assigned what services are available to the children there and what services are available in the community.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So there'll be a lot of stuff around that for the children.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then you go back to, if you remember the LGBTQI+, it keeps changing.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it LGBTQI+, or is it LGBTQ?

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It keeps changing.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But the members of the LGBT, what kind of supports are available for them? So you have a shout and you have a mock.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's what they'd want to get from this.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So they're specifically designed to support people that are going through domestic violence within that cohort of people as well.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm rambling here, am I?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no, no. I'm just trying to think of it as kind of an interaction in the app.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If somebody just types in the question, how do I access support in Galway City?

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is there any point in giving them some answer to that at that point, or do you need follow-up questions?

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You need follow-up questions because you don't know what kind of support they're looking for.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, so you'd need them to tell you their gender.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, it would be nice because, like, Moella don't take males.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So they would need to know their gender.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But that wouldn't be straight away.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, it would have to be, because if you're a man, you're looking up to see a refuge center.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He might show up to...

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The other thing you often see with things like ChatGPT is that it'll give you a response,

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and then it will say, if you'd like more specific information, tell them your gender or something like that.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, okay.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So it can kind of give a...

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That'll probably make more sense, yeah.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
...a bit of a response and then say, you know, yeah.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What they also...

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What supports are available to the guards and the courts?

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So you're talking here about baron orders, protected orders, safety orders.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hmm.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They would need to be built in as well.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So what kind of protective measures are out there for me if I come forward?

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That kind of way.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If that makes sense.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I suppose you just need to split them up into different categories, like...

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
...you know, kind of...

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like what we're doing with the act kind of way.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, we start with that support one and see what we get back, and then maybe we can

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
add some detail on gender and children and see...

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you have some kind of way to set up here?

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Can you just talk back to me, can I?

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can, yeah.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Not sure.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you just kind of type or tell us what to type?

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just say, what supports are available to me?

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, hang on.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That...

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hang on, hang on.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hang on, hang on.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is it very short questions we ask?

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Or is it free?

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, it'd be...

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, it's...

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It can be long-winded if they need to be.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, I'd just say, I'm a survivor of domestic violence.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What supports are available to me?

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Right.

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you wanna...

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't give it my type of day.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I am a survivor...

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Of...

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, what did I say now?

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, I think we can also like...

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, survivor, no.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:17,040
Let's see what goes back, maybe nothing In reality you'll probably get some people

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm getting a laugh actually

167
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,600
But if I'm looking at that now gosh, that's bullshit in relation to can I scroll up there again, yeah

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
It's still generating

169
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,240
This one here on the right hand side is the kind of normal chat GPT

170
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,640
Yeah, and the other one is the one that uses the stuff okay from the website. It's just the idea of

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,360
Well, this is also from from everywhere USA UK yeah, I'll see

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you want to put it in Ireland? Sorry? I should have put that in the question. Should I know this is the one

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
This is like for

174
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,680
This will not show to the user, but now for for test, okay

175
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,960
So what came up there then for Ireland sir?

176
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm sorry the one you're building

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
Sir what supports came up?

178
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,240
I think it didn't give anything. Okay. The question was a little bit

179
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
Should be more like what refuges are available in glory

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
I

181
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,480
Should be about like what refuges are available

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Possibly yeah, yeah

183
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,280
Is that what you if somebody asked for what supports are available?

184
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,000
Would you expect the refuges to come up like yeah, whatever? Yeah, you would you okay? Yeah

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:05,000
It will need know your location right yeah, so okay, so like if the question is like this

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,720
At least I need you I need to the chat bot should ask the user's location

187
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,560
Okay before it give the answer. Is that correct? Yeah, I guess if it's enough it might be yeah

188
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
location

189
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,560
GPS but yeah, I mean for this example, maybe

190
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,400
We should provide it explicitly in the in the question, let's say what refuges are available in goldway

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,520
How big are you making this is this stick for nationwide or sir and I

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Could be yeah

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,100
Suppose it depends on access to it to relevant information

194
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,080
That supports are available to me and go away maybe what refuges

195
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Say it's the running to me

197
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,120
Is it okay, so don't just worry when you get it funny. Yeah, that's it. Okay

198
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Okay, she's looking up there no boy that's not there's a domestic violence response

199
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
But

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,780
This it says there are 20

201
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,340
It's still key didn't give you the space like to lose the gingerbread. Oh, yeah

202
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Yeah, shouldn't give the name of the areas push

203
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Is this a little bit around sir

204
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,080
Yeah, but that would definitely be one as well depends on

205
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,800
Their nature of their domestic violence relationship, but that actually would be there that would be in it as well. Sorry

206
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,960
So these are the answer I should get in this robot this chatbot

207
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,680
Where is Chuck Darragh from the refuge corporation record this chapter?

208
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
So the woman's refuge I

209
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,320
Said that this one doesn't tell us where the information was sourced from

210
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,080
I guess the other one does because we've provided the information

211
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,080
Women's Refuge

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Corporation Road

213
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I

214
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
So this is the one if the

215
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
like

216
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,340
The best model like like if I didn't give it any information

217
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,460
Okay, this is all from their like original training data

218
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,740
Okay. Yeah, so I want to improve their performance

219
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,340
Okay, give the better more in detail information

220
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
But here since

221
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,740
It's just a prototype. Yes. Okay. I think it's

222
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Worse than this. Yes. Yes

223
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
You

224
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Here I think cobra Louis

225
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:25,700
So what's coming up here is better than what we have over here. But the main one is not

226
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,740
there. Moetta is the first main point of contact that you would need if you're a female.

227
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,860
You're looking for support. Wanting to leave the house with the children. It's the one

228
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:43,380
thing that they always go for. And obviously there could be questions about Moetta as well.

229
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:51,380
So where I can get the information? Moetta. You Google Moetta. That's how much you're looking

230
00:15:51,380 --> 00:16:03,060
for. Yeah, yeah. All the information that you require. Moetta. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e.

231
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:30,780
Two words you said here. Cope. It's under cope. That's the main one for women. And then

232
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,620
that takes the role of the children because they take the women and the children into

233
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,100
the refuge. There's their own apartment on the side of the refuge, which is great. It's

234
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,500
not communal spaces anymore. It's like an apartment block. So that is the most ideal

235
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,500
one for the women. For the men, if you're asking what supports are available for men,

236
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,420
they're very limited as we know. You'd be talking about Men's Network. But they're based

237
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,860
in Waterford. But they cover the whole country through counselling. And they also offer legal

238
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:14,060
support if needed, which is great. So if you're a father, you are going to be looking for

239
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,060
the same things, like what's available for me out there. When I'm in domestic violence

240
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,860
for five years, I've had enough. Can I get her out? How do I get her out of the house?

241
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,940
So you're talking here about what are the orders? The courts. If you want to do that,

242
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,700
just separate. As I said, supports, then maybe look at the finance. Housing is going to be

243
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,740
huge. It's going to be huge anywhere. Massive. So I'd be kind of like stuff around having

244
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,020
the same community there with a helpline, counter-council, having the, you know. Would

245
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,180
this give websites, if you ask for it, could I get the website for a call with counter-council?

246
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,820
Yeah. And then you get the social housing form. And then you have the, whatever kind

247
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:04,100
of support the council can offer. Can I apply for a deposit for under the domestic violence

248
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,940
provision? Yes, you can. How will they go about doing that? So you've got one section

249
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,260
just on finance to include all that. So if Anto comes up on finance, on the question,

250
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,780
it'll bring it straight to that section that should be developed in your letter. Yeah.

251
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:29,660
Is, are the kind of answers to those questions, um, published in different places? Not really.

252
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:37,780
Not really. No, not really. They say it's here, but here's the, here's the social, sorry,

253
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,660
just the form of social housing, but yet you have to go to revenue. Yeah. And then you

254
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,180
have to go and you have to get an affidavit signed and people get overwhelmed by that

255
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,300
then. So it's about having the support that will help them go through that is what's needed.

256
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,380
Unless they're well able to go themselves. But for the very start, when people are contacted

257
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,420
and are using this, it is crisis management. Where can I go right now? It's quarter past

258
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,140
one on a Friday. I need to get the hell out of here before he comes home. Where do I go?

259
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,380
What's this? Oh, Pops Moella. They contact Moella. Are you safe or do we need to contact

260
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,660
the guards to bring you here? Yeah. That's the question that will come back to me. But

261
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:27,180
what you just want for the, for this is to give them information on Moella. Yeah. What's

262
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:51,660
this query? I just asked. I'm a man. Where can I go?

263
00:19:51,660 --> 00:20:01,820
So before this, I want to know like these, like basic answers. Are they accurate? Yes.

264
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,100
That's correct. Go around crisis. Okay. I haven't heard of transgender quality network

265
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:15,460
Ireland. So it says a service to people in Galway, but they must exist somewhere. But

266
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:26,500
there's a lot of stuff that's stable. It's fairly. No, none of that. None of that. All

267
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,220
that. No. Okay. So you would take a one. Yes. 100%. Call your rape crisis. Definitely would

268
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:40,420
be involved in that. Okay. Yeah. They would be kind of providing counseling at a later

269
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:51,140
stage more so than after family leave. That's the direction. So one, I think one problems

270
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,780
may, maybe the, the, the, the base model is sometimes they, they, they cannot give you

271
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,060
the accurate information. And I think in this situation, the, the accuracy is important.

272
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:15,860
So yeah, but, so I thought maybe, no, I mean, in my chatbot, sometimes the, they cannot

273
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:24,980
find the information, but at least I need to make sure the accuracy of the information.

274
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:44,500
And wait a sec. Where's the, where's my, where's my, the, the question I'm a man. Okay. Here.

275
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:54,060
So another thing is you mentioned the, like the, when, when people ask for support, like

276
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,740
the house finance, all this stuff, do, do you, do you mean then in this chatbot, it,

277
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,200
it doesn't need to give you this instructions. It only need to give you the information where

278
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:25,400
you can find the, where you need to go, where you need to go. Okay. Do you want to try one

279
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:35,000
of it? The children, something like I've got two children, what supports are available

280
00:22:35,000 --> 00:23:00,200
for them? Where should I go? What can I get? What, what support can I, can they get? For

281
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,960
example, you know, it's going into, it's coming into stuff like, you know, 10 GP services.

282
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,080
That's kind of straightforward enough really. Um, free counseling services. Okay. I should

283
00:23:45,080 --> 00:24:00,000
be looking at your one over here. Should I? Oh, okay. You'd expect rainbows to be coming

284
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,640
up there now. They're, they're a national organization as well, but that's their own

285
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,040
bereavement. But it's a bit, it's also about lots of parents, even though it doesn't have

286
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,800
to be bereaved or separated. They're going to be separated as a result of this. So that

287
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,040
would be one support that would come up. And it's a national organization. Should you just

288
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:29,400
put in rainbows? They're their rainbows, Ireland. So they're based all over the country. Okay.

289
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,720
It would be a good support for, now you have to be six months separated or six months before

290
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,640
you can go on and put their rain all over the place. But it is a good support for, for

291
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,440
children because it's specifically designed for, as I said, breach or separate parents.

292
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,760
Okay. The only difference is if you're in a group you're never put in with a group who's

293
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,760
separated if you're, with your parents bereaved. Okay. Obviously. So you're definitely getting

294
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,000
the one to one support and those groups are very small, doing it in around three. Okay.

295
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,560
It's going to be 54 or 55 kids in the evening, so only three in it. It's a great service

296
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,400
to have. It would be a service that parents would be looking for, but not for our parents

297
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:14,600
would know about it. Right. Okay. Yeah. So that would be one kind of aspect. Yeah. So

298
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,240
is there a rainbows program in Galway? I thought it was a voice recognition thing as well.

299
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:34,480
I haven't tried, I haven't tried. Oh, sorry. Is there, sorry. I get lazy. Is there a rainbows

300
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:57,800
program in Galway? What? Thank you. Good.

301
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:41,760
Where does it start again? There. The once more, yeah. See the rainbows Ireland program

302
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,280
for children who have experienced death and force or other fabric changes. Okay. That's

303
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,240
all there. Yeah. We're talking about complaints and Brussels and all that kind of stuff. To

304
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,400
you. So it would be the main one here. Definitely there. He just, he never heard of that service

305
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,520
club and clinic or that and it's going down into what you watch. We'd have both local

306
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,120
schools and communities and just go ahead and pay agency. I assume kind of shorter responses

307
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,120
or more of what people would be after to the point. If you think that if you're in a crisis

308
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,200
where the fuck can I go? Yeah. And like, you know, is he going to follow me? Yeah. How

309
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,480
do I get there? Yeah. Yeah. Should it be taxi numbers? Can I get a taxi? Can you book a

310
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,560
taxi from this? Yeah. Yeah. You know, if you get to my wallet, I'd actually pay for your

311
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,920
taxi if you didn't want to pay for the taxi. Okay. It's a great service. Like if you're

312
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:50,040
living out in that really like if you're over kind of is where that lady was from was Glinsk.

313
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,880
There's nothing, no taxes over there. So we had to bring her from Glinsk into Mowell

314
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,280
and Galway with six kids. That was a fun drive. Yeah. Cause kids wanted to be with Bellamy

315
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:10,920
and the car. Of course. So seven seater kids. Yeah. One extra overload. Overload. Yeah. Needs

316
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:19,920
most. Yeah. Needs most. Yeah, exactly. Squad car going ahead of us. Yeah. So some of these

317
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,480
things are good. Some of them are. It's really giving you a lot of information to find out

318
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
the rainbows for a lot of direct wind contact. Local, you're not going to be contacted. There's

319
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:37,240
no, I, in my knowledge base, there's no information about this website. So it didn't give anything.

320
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:46,160
Okay. All right. Is there any kind of testimonials, something like testimonials that would exist

321
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,320
where victims would describe the actual, you know, the fact that I went to Mowella because,

322
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,400
and they helped me with XYZ. As I said to you, I emailed to Mowella to give me a few

323
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:04,920
testimonials and they never got back to me. Okay. Yeah. So I think it's, it's that kind

324
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:13,240
of, I see the testimonials as a place where it puts all of the stuff, the reason why things

325
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,080
are done together and it kind of puts relevant stuff together. And that's all stuff that is

326
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,200
something that a model like this could pick up on and use. So kind of joining the dots rather

327
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,120
than just a directory of information, but you don't really know why you need that stuff. So I

328
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:42,480
think to make it more useful, something like those would be good. I mean, the only other thing I can

329
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,040
think of beyond that is like if we sat down and did an interview with you and transcribed the

330
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,680
whole thing where you're talking through these things, but that's something then that could

331
00:29:51,680 --> 00:30:01,000
probably go out on a date and that sort of thing. But it's this, I think the thing that's hard to,

332
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:11,360
to get at is, you know, you would do this because, and this will help you with XYZ. And when you do

333
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,240
that, you might do this kind of connecting it to come up with a, you know, a plan or something

334
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,760
that's relevant for a particular, someone's particular situation. Well, it's, it's, it's,

335
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,160
it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a very basic enough, right? You would go to a refuge, which

336
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,760
your kids, and they try and locate you in a different area, get the court system behind you,

337
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,320
get a baron orders, that guy can go near them for five years. That's the kind of it. And they're

338
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,240
happy with that. And that's 100%. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. Because they only have a two year old

339
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,400
and don't be seven. You know, you have a 12 year old and there's an older 17. Yeah. So

340
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,760
self determinate all that kind of stuff themselves. But that's really what they want. That's where

341
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,240
can I go? Where am I safe? Where are the kids safe? Yeah. Like, I can't imagine you use this

342
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,720
when you're post after that. When you're say, when you're inside, are you going to go look

343
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,720
for this again? Housing is a great idea. But I'll go back to the chatbot again and see, can they

344
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,800
give me information on housing? Whereas citizens information, I'm not, not by any means. It's

345
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,800
great. I'm just trying to give the idea like a success story or this it's basic enough of what

346
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,120
the success will be. Yeah. It's very easy to say it. But the reality is I'm trying to find a house

347
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,000
for someone to move into. Yeah, it's very difficult. And then you talk about the schools,

348
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,360
changing our schools, how to change the schools, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So like,

349
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,560
whatever it is that you're trying to get from this, is it to give it to me as much information

350
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,600
as possible, then that will become overpowering to me. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know, so even like,

351
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,040
give me four or five of the top ones will be ideal. Yeah. So what we're trying to understand

352
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,400
is what would be useful to get out of it. And then how can we tweak it so that it does

353
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,680
produce that. So in a way, we're trying to get in the heads of somebody who would be using it. And,

354
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:15,760
you know, in some ways, it's probably about making sure that the answers to their questions

355
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,640
are accurate. But then there's probably other roles that could have like, like, if there's

356
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,000
stuff that they, you know, hadn't thought about asking, but would be useful for them to know,

357
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,560
at this point in their kind of situation, then the chatbot can provide information on those

358
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:42,720
things as well and give them a sense of what that journey ahead might look like to, I suppose,

359
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,280
illustrate that, you know, there's a way out of it. Yeah. That's what the testimonials were

360
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:56,880
probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. So, so I think what would you like to have from the

361
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:08,480
testimonials? What kind of, um, so rather than doing an interview now with people, what would be

362
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:20,240
I, uh, this is, this is all kind of based on what I think would be useful. It doesn't necessarily

363
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:31,600
mean it would be, but, um, from, from, from what I think the testimonials could describe someone's

364
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:40,040
situation that they found themselves in, um, and describe their journey or their path to getting

365
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:48,240
support, things that worked well, things that didn't. And if you had enough of those, um, then,

366
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:56,200
uh, and you were able to provide them to something like this, then it would be able to pick the bits

367
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,640
that are relevant from different ones to find the ones that are relevant to a particular person's

368
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:09,920
situation and to use those to generate a response. So it's a man with children who, um, is in some

369
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,040
particular situation and there might be, if you had like a few different testimonials that kind of

370
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,880
match that, um, then there might be some say in the right location. And so you might be able to

371
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,320
kind of pick bits from them to kind of kind of frame your answer based on that frame, you know,

372
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:38,480
someone's experiences rather than, um, cause I think it's in that way, it's, it would allow you

373
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:47,920
to provide responses that, um, don't just present a particular service in isolation, but it's more

374
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,840
presenting it that in a way that, you know, you might need this, this and this because somebody

375
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,320
else did and found those useful and they were in a similar situation to you, which you wouldn't get

376
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,440
from any of those individual websites, but you get it because this person experienced that and that

377
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,280
worked for them. So it's the testimonials for me provide a way of linking different services, um,

378
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,160
to provide a useful journey for somebody out of that situation. Okay. I should have written down

379
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:29,360
that. You can give me a transcript of that. I actually could get you a few testimonials from

380
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,800
our case that are open to us at the moment. They're coming towards the end of it. Right. But

381
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,080
if you could type up those questions that you just said there, I can run that by them. Yeah.

382
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,320
Yeah. Definitely get four testimonials. Anyway, like one will talk for Ireland, like, you know,

383
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,000
yeah. Or she's good. If that's what you want, that's what's needed. What do you think would be

384
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,520
useful? Uh, the thing you said, the testimonial part, does that mean, uh, I need to, the chatbot

385
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,640
need to ask the user a lot of information. Possibly, yeah. But will the user willing to

386
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,760
type so many things? It's like almost like type, uh, all the

387
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,200
story. Well, I'm thinking that you might get at something like the, um, chatbot might say,

388
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:34,240
um, yes, we have various different organizations that offer support. Some of these are specific to

389
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,000
men. Some are specific to, to women. Um, if you'd like more detail on any of these,

390
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,640
let me know if you're a man or a woman, I might just type man. And then I might go into more

391
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:54,800
detail on this. And all of that is forming an interaction then that, um, the, obviously the

392
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,240
way that these work is that pre the previous conversation is taken into account in any

393
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,920
responses. So they've already declared they're a man and other answers could take that into

394
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,920
account as well. So you need to keep restating the situation, but it's more like with a support

395
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,920
worker, they would develop an understanding over time and only, uh, present stuff that's relevant.

396
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,400
If you were to get testimonials like that, and that was your main source of data, you'd probably

397
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,320
need a lot of them, wouldn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably the limiting factor here is that,

398
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,600
um, unless there there's a good source and it's readily available,

399
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,920
it's probably unrealistic to ask you to produce the event you would need to come up with any kind

400
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:53,920
of good answers to it. So, um, in that case, we'd, we'd need to try and I suppose just make best use

401
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:07,440
of the stuff that is available. Um, yeah. Um, yeah. So, um, the information part is definitely

402
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:17,440
need to improve the, you said the testimony part, uh, if they're just like, not, I don't,

403
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:26,400
I don't get so many data should I still use this? Well, one thing we could think about doing is to

404
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:37,280
kind of think about it as a, as a kind of a feasibility or, um, uh, of the tool for maybe

405
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,320
one particular user group. So we could try and get like, I don't know, 10 testimonials or something

406
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:53,280
that are all from people in a similar area or maybe similar gender, and then just, um,

407
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,440
kind of test whether or not if we were playing the part of somebody in a similar role,

408
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,680
would we get better responses if we had those testimonials available? Um, and that would just

409
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,120
allow us to kind of, yeah, test whether that testimonial approach would be something that was

410
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,760
worth pursuing if we did have resources to do that or whether, you know, the responses

411
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,600
actually aren't much better if you do have that data. Um, that could be one, one, um, way to go.

412
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,560
The localization of things is, is another important aspects. Yeah.

413
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,760
So that's something to think about. How, how do you do that?

414
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,240
Is that something that can be picked up in the scraping or is it something that

415
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,520
would need someone to manually tie things that

416
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,360
if I ask us about an action rather than just what's available. So how do I get support?

417
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:10,480
Hmm. The other thing with a testimonial as well is it would probably include things like multiple

418
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,040
factors like housing, finance, children, that sort of thing that the chatbot could use to

419
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,600
structure answers and say, um, here's areas that people commonly need to consider. Is there any

420
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:30,480
of these that you would, um, you know, well, that's all good. It's all the finance stuff

421
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,640
there and all that. Don't know how much we're just getting it all from, but just go up again.

422
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,720
I think the format is broken or something. Where's my question?

423
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,600
How do I get support? So it's telling me there about immediate safety. It's the contact

424
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,600
guardians, other ones, domestic violence service, seek refuge in shelter. That's all there.

425
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,120
Haven though, if you're homeless or need emergency, the Haven can provide shelter.

426
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
The Haven. Never heard that in Galway is it? Yeah.

427
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:15,120
It's Haven Galway. H-A-V-E-N. I'm going to address here Boundary Avenue.

428
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,080
It's an apartment that you can rent at booking.com.

429
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:31,120
It's a apartment? One Boundary Avenue.

430
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:45,760
Meals are in Project Burger, Car of Haven, Family Hope.

431
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,120
Chop Car of Day Center.

432
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:05,760
There's Car of Haven, Family Hope, and that's what it's referred to.

433
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,240
But again, that's not much use to you if... No.

434
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,720
This is going to react to all the legal advice. That's actually not bad. If you ask actions

435
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:25,840
rather than give me, you get more of a... So what was your restaurant there?

436
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,680
I just asked, how do I get support? How? How? Okay.

437
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,160
Rather than what's available, you're going to get everything.

438
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:45,200
There's a few sites that we've come across. How do I go to refuge?

439
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Pretty straightforward. I don't see why they'll give me that.

440
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,720
They'll tell you why you would go to a refuge.

441
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,160
That's actually a good question as well. Why would I go to a refuge?

442
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,040
I'm just going to put it out to the loo for a second.

443
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,680
Sorry.

444
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,000
There's a lot of information which is generated for that one.

445
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm not destroying it now.

446
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,920
Is this perhaps a PhD for you, or is it a master's or...

447
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,960
Master. In artificial intelligence, is it?

448
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,160
In what?

449
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,960
Artific... AI?

450
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,200
No, it's data analytics. It's very similar to AI. We have a lot of same class.

451
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,600
Okay.

452
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,100
Yeah.

453
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,440
This is law school overnight now.

454
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,400
It's never stopped.

455
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,280
Can I stop it?

456
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,400
Yeah. Is something wrong happened?

457
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,280
Right. It's some...

458
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,080
There are not some meaningful words?

459
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,320
No.

460
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,200
No meaningful?

461
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,920
No.

462
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
Okay. Something is wrong here.

463
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,320
Oh, come on.

464
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
I think something is wrong here.

465
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,880
I think it's in your loop, the software.

466
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:50,160
I cannot hear.

467
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,960
Okay. The website is in freeze, I think.

468
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,280
Okay. I killed the website, totally.

469
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,160
Okay. This is the...

470
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,800
You okay for talking to me, man?

471
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,360
Yeah, I'm okay.

472
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,920
The best model, there's something wrong in the best model.

473
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,400
It's... Continue to give all the nonsense words.

474
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,480
All right. Okay. Yeah.

475
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,880
I don't know what's wrong here. See?

476
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,320
Right. Okay.

477
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,520
It's even freeze the web page.

478
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,760
Okay. What's the question you asked?

479
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,880
What was the question?

480
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:07,680
How do I go to a refuge here?

481
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,560
Maybe a typo?

482
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,120
No, but here my rag for this is good.

483
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,040
Okay. In terms of the...

484
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,280
You mentioned those things that you would want to know for each thing.

485
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,880
It was the... How? What?

486
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,320
The with the why. That's the best of the first in those questions.

487
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:33,680
Right.

488
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,200
Something very short and snappy.

489
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,720
How do I go to a refuge?

490
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,960
What's available to me in a refuge?

491
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,560
Where do I get counselling?

492
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
Tell them that's it. Where would I get counselling?

493
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,640
So you get everything here now again.

494
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,680
How do you spell counselling?

495
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,480
C-O-U-N.

496
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,600
C-O-U-N.

497
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:10,400
Because we can ask the model to provide answers in particular formats as well.

498
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:19,040
So if the why or whatever was always important, then you could incorporate that into the responses.

499
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,200
And maybe that's something that is worth doing because everything you suggest,

500
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,560
somebody would probably want an explanation to...

501
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,120
Why would they do that in the first place and what would they get out of it?

502
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,760
So knowing what they would want from those responses will help us structure things better.

503
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,200
Where do I get counselling?

504
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,440
Okay, this is the first time the body is quicker than this one.

505
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,000
Oh no, I think it's the incident situation again.

506
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,760
It won't stop.

507
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,720
I think there's some bug there.

508
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,720
It won't stop.

509
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,440
And then the page freeze.

510
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,920
So what's your in-project look like here?

511
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:58,240
So, if we get this to a state where it's providing sufficient answers,

512
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,160
your end product could take different forms.

513
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,520
It could be something on a website, it could be something in a mobile app.

514
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,640
So the end product, as I imagine it is, it's a mobile app that you can use in discrete mode.

515
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,880
And it's just a simple interface like this.

516
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,160
You ask questions, but it provides all of the information that you would get from

517
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,200
the kind of app that we were looking at before, but it provides it in a way that

518
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,800
makes the information easier to access.

519
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,760
But also, one thing that we talked about is that depending on the situation of the person,

520
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,480
you could customize the way what information is presented and what's not.

521
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,560
The bot can do that as well.

522
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,280
It can customize things to people's situations.

523
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Rather than being kind of clunky that it just reorders boxes to show you what information.

524
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,160
I see that as stuff that keeps popping up here in relation to physical abuse.

525
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,880
It's more about just coercive control.

526
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,960
That's the main thing about domestic violence.

527
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,520
How do I know that I'm in a coercive control relationship?

528
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:34,640
No, I mean, I feel it's something wrong in my program.

529
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh, I forgot again.

530
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,840
No, they're okay.

531
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,000
No, it can never stop now.

532
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,600
It's like in a loop or something.

533
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,320
They actually gave good information at the start of that.

534
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,200
Yeah, yes.

535
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,040
They did actually give good information.

536
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,400
I don't know that lady.

537
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,840
She rang and it was me.

538
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,720
She was contacted.

539
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,240
She rang me.

540
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,840
It was quarter past four on a Tuesday evening.

541
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,400
She rang me.

542
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,160
She said she'd been looking up.

543
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,400
She said she could all have kept coming up with Tuesday.

544
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,760
So she wouldn't give her name.

545
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,440
She wouldn't give her kids names or nothing.

546
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,120
She wouldn't know what is available for her right now.

547
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,120
He's not home till 8 o'clock this evening.

548
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:19,760
He's at work.

549
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,760
She says, I'm sitting here.

550
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,480
My two guys are bleeding and he's after hitting one of the children.

551
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,600
I don't want to stand by that.

552
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
I need to get out of here.

553
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,280
Do I call the guards or who do I call?

554
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
I said, well, are you safe when he comes home?

555
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,960
So I know she says I'm petrified.

556
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,960
I said, have you anywhere to go?

557
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,680
She said, no.

558
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
Do you want me to create a place for you to go?

559
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,120
And then I told her about Moila.

560
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,760
What's Moila?

561
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,520
I said, well, look, we've got four hours.

562
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,320
Do you want to have a look at Moila on the website yourself and see what you think?

563
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
She still wouldn't give me her name or address or anything.

564
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,760
So she went off.

565
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,960
She looked at Moila.

566
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,160
I told her, I'm going to stay on the phone because I wouldn't let her go.

567
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,960
So she got back and she goes, that's where I need to go.

568
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,480
Can you make that happen?

569
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,040
I said, I can't, but give me a minute to make sure there's a bed available for you.

570
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah.

571
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,040
And there were random, there was.

572
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,360
And then basically they said, we're going to contact the guards.

573
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,840
I said, well, I don't even see no dates.

574
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,080
She doesn't want to give me anything because she hears I'm too slow.

575
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
But yeah, she's going to, she arranged, she arranged.

576
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,640
She met me at the local center shop over in Winhamstown.

577
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,800
A very small little dinky shop.

578
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,880
And there she was herself, just the children and their suitcases at the side of the road

579
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,880
waiting to know if I got a puncture or God forbid anything happened, you know,

580
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,760
but pick them up, brought them in and still wouldn't give me her name.

581
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,440
But she wasn't from Glynamada.

582
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,880
She got texted to Glynamada.

583
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,320
She was from Glyn.

584
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,720
I found out afterwards.

585
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,200
So yeah, so now she's, she's open to our service and she will answer any of those.

586
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,120
But she said, I just needed to get out.

587
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,880
I didn't care where I went.

588
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,840
I just needed to get out.

589
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,200
And then when you're in a place of safety, then all of the other stuff starts coming in.

590
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,240
Eventually I feel safe here.

591
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,120
This is what I want.

592
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,400
How do I remain keeping myself safe?

593
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,600
Do I get support to go to court?

595
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,520
Who helps me if I go to court?

596
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,160
Yeah.

597
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,080
Do, how do I access legal aid?

598
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,200
There is, I know that you're kind of saying you want more of an interface kind of thing,

599
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,880
but it is a lot of people would be asked to direct questions.

600
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,640
Like, as I said, they're like, how do I access legal aid?

601
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,440
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:26,560
Yeah.

603
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,200
That's not what you're, I know that we're kind of coming at it from different angles.

604
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,080
No, that is what we're trying to find out is what would people want to ask?

605
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,560
Yeah.

606
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,000
What they want responses for.

607
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,640
So like a lot of my ideas for what it would look like come from my limited understanding

608
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,760
from just working on the last project.

609
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:54,000
So we're trying to come to a better understanding of, you know, what it should look like and

610
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
how people would want to interact with it.

611
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,320
And then the kind of results that they would really need to get back

612
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
from it that would be most relevant.

613
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,720
I think it'd be very good at the very start to get them to a place where they're safe.

614
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,680
Then they'd forget about it until they want to move on.

615
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,400
Yeah.

616
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,720
And then that's when they'll come back and help me the first time,

617
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,920
they might help me this time.

618
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,800
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,320
So getting them to a place where they're safe.

620
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,640
Yes.

621
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,760
Is that the primary?

622
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,720
That's the main thing.

623
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,920
That's the main thing and the main reason for this as well.

624
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,240
Yeah.

625
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:24,960
Okay.

626
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,320
Where they feel safe.

627
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:33,040
And you came up with some websites that we hadn't come across before, but is there like a

628
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
a list of even just for Galway and people that you would deal with,

629
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,480
is there like a list of websites or organizations?

630
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,920
Oh yes, I came in with lots of them.

631
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,120
You wrote some of his papers.

632
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,600
Yeah, yeah.

633
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,480
Tell me what you want and what I can get for you and we'll see where we can go from there.

634
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,800
Websites.

635
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,480
I've never heard of that Carb Haven Family Hub now.

636
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,440
Is that a residential place?

637
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,600
Carb Haven.

638
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,480
Supported temporary accommodation.

639
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,200
Ten families experience homelessness in Galway City.

640
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,160
Oh, it's homelessness.

641
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,720
That's that domestic violence relation to the club.

642
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,480
Unless I suppose you're homeless as a result.

643
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:30,880
Okay.

644
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,520
Okay.

645
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,080
We started to get in there nowadays.

646
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,120
It's awful.

647
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,320
When you see the the care and then when you're a male, the one question I said,

648
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,280
I ignore would you prefer a female staff member to come collect you?

649
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,360
Yeah, so.

650
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,600
This is a great thing.

651
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
If you get lost growing, you'll be nervous.

652
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, so really it's a chatbot and you know we're using it here on a laptop and

653
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,520
you know if we got it in a position that it was useful, you could embed it in anything.

654
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,800
So, you know, if you thought it was a good idea to turn it into an app once we've

655
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,760
got something that doesn't have everything.

656
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,880
We even have the server though.

657
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,280
Yeah.

658
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,240
But we'll shake it out.

659
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,060
Yeah.

660
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,640
We have that for the whole server.

661
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,680
I didn't get the server.

662
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,880
That thing I sent out to you wasn't your completion.

663
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,720
Don't see this.

664
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,400
The answer since that's a sit on to you as well.

665
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,880
I didn't go into the code myself.

666
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,840
I couldn't even do where to go with that.

667
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,600
Yeah.

668
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,240
It was it was complete.

669
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,200
It was completed.

670
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,920
Yeah.

671
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,560
Two little things that you had to finish and then that's what it all does well.

672
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,240
I was disappointed how that ended up.

673
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,740
Yeah.

674
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,240
Okay, so is there anything, so I think a list of websites that we obviously haven't included.

675
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,840
Yeah, or maybe like some PDF file.

676
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,680
But like the store this information.

677
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,420
No, no.

678
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,080
The website is now.

679
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,080
No, I mean, because like you can scrape it once you have two websites.

680
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,640
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:42,080
I mean, this information are all from the website.

682
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:51,680
I mean, if they are all if they some of them also like some PDF file, some like legal file, some.

683
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,520
So so like documents that you might provide people with information, is it?

684
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,440
No, I mean, like the government will have some documents.

685
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,500
Okay.

686
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,340
No documents about these things.

687
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,940
Like, do I need that?

688
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,780
Do I need to extract information from that?

689
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:24,500
So I'm thinking just there's a lot of stuff on the app that you could pull from it.

690
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,420
There was a lot of good information that was on that.

691
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,540
Yeah.

692
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,220
If you can open the code, I don't know.

693
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,100
Yeah, that's your baby.

694
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,600
Yeah.

695
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,320
There was a question sent you that already.

696
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,520
The previous app had a database.

697
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,080
Yeah, yeah.

698
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,580
Yeah.

699
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,000
There was a lot of information on that that would fit into that as well.

700
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,060
Yeah.

701
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,620
Yeah.

702
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,340
Okay.

703
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,200
So yeah, that's that's something that.

704
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,700
Yeah.

705
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,280
Even the headings of it, if you create just a question around the headings that were on it.

706
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,420
Yeah.

707
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,020
I think we have a list of all those are broken down.

708
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,780
That's where it is.

709
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,280
Yeah.

710
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,540
All the websites associated with each and they're broken down.

711
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,040
There.

712
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,140
That's where they are.

713
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,640
Yeah.

714
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,840
Yeah.

715
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,540
I'll have a look at that again.

716
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,040
Yeah.

717
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,220
That's what it says to me for doing there.

718
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:18,940
It's there.

719
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,440
Yeah.

720
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,160
Okay.

721
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:20,800
Yeah.

722
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,660
I just broke it down sections or the housing sections.

723
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,040
Yeah.

724
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,960
There's a lot of contact details over there with a lot of services on this.

725
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,460
Yeah.

726
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,240
Don't know why I don't have it on, but it's the haven I've ever heard of that.

727
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,840
And we've probably had some of that kind of how or what.

729
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,640
Yes, good idea.

730
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,600
It was all that.

731
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,760
How do you know you're in a vital relationship?

732
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,260
Yeah.

733
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:42,900
Yeah.

734
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,960
And I know that that was a questionnaire, but they could become questions for that as well.

735
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,660
Yeah.

736
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,480
The more questions you give it the better.

737
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

738
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:51,780
Yeah.

739
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,160
What about testimonials?

740
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,040
I think that would be useful to try and get some...

741
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,960
I can follow up with them while I get...

742
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,460
Yeah.

743
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,280
Now, what they'll give me is like, like you're talking about testimonials of a...

744
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,160
I'm talking about testimonials of like four or five lines and that's all you'll get now.

745
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,660
Okay.

746
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,000
Yeah, no, that's probably...

747
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,360
In the testimonial books...

748
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,840
You want the testimonials that gonna tell you...

749
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,240
What worked for them.

750
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,240
You want a three or four page answer.

751
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,360
What worked for you.

752
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,860
Yeah.

753
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,580
Yeah.

754
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,760
So that then that's kind of knowledge then that can be extracted that, you know,

755
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,480
these services were important in this situation, that kind of thing.

756
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:44,320
So, yeah, if you kind of can get any of those sort of following up anyway...

757
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,820
Yes.

758
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,400
Not, we'll just have to...

759
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,560
That's enough to see what's going back.

760
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,060
Yeah.

761
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:49,940
Okay.

762
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,700
If you can take those questions that are on that,

763
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,180
what you would up there, the tangent there, all these questions.

764
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,540
If you can get these off that, send them on to me as well.

765
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,040
Right.

766
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,020
I can ask a few of the victims, the survivors that we have.

767
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,520
Yeah.

768
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,180
A few of the questions in relation to that.

769
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:08,680
Yeah.

770
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,480
Yeah.

771
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:09,980
Okay.

772
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,720
Yeah.

773
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,540
That could be.

774
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,040
Yeah.

775
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,820
If you can remember them or you can just get them off that.

776
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:15,320
Yeah.

777
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,280
Okay.

778
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,160
Yeah.

779
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,100
I'll have to think about that.

780
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,600
Yeah.

781
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,320
That's it.

782
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,720
Whatever you want from the thing and all it can do is go and ask them.

783
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,220
Yeah.

784
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,000
That's the main thing.

785
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:35,080
And I think that the next step then is keep working on it and we'll play around with the

786
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:40,360
models themselves and the output they produce and at some point we might go to you or get

787
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,840
the information again and just kind of show you some different options that we've come

788
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,760
up with for responses and just see which ones make sense and which ones don't.

789
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,260
Yeah.

790
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,480
I'll bring one of my colleagues with me today.

791
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,080
I tried to bring her today.

792
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:57,400
She couldn't have got a new worker and her previous worker today was, she was just the

793
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,400
best she finds a poor person for too long.

794
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,120
Oh right.

795
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,620
So.

796
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,260
Yeah.

797
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,760
She would have been very useful to have.

798
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,260
Yeah.

799
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,760
So I will bring her with me the next time.

800
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,260
Yeah.

801
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,760
Okay.

802
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,260
Yeah.

803
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:06,760
Yeah.

804
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,260
Brilliant.

805
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,260
That sounds good.

806
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:08,760
Yeah.

807
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,260
Yeah.

808
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:09,760
It's okay?

809
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,260
Sounds good.

810
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:10,760
Yeah.

811
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,260
Nice to meet you.

812
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:11,760
Thanks a million.

813
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,260
Adrian.

814
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:12,760
Be in touch?

815
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,260
Yeah.

816
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:13,760
Okay.

817
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,260
See you later.

818
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:14,760
See you guys.

819
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,260
Bye.

820
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:15,760
Have a nice day.

821
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,820
Bye.

822
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,820
Now I don't know.

823
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,320
Yeah.

824
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
What we need to looks like.

825
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:52,820
Yeah.

826
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,320
Yeah.

827
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:53,820
Yeah.

828
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,320
Maybe it's useful.

829
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,820
Maybe it's not so useful.

830
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,320
Yeah.

831
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:56,820
Yeah.

832
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,320
But we will see.

833
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:57,820
Yeah.

834
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,320
Yeah.

835
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,820
I think.

836
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,320
Yeah.

837
01:02:59,320 --> 01:02:59,820
Definitely.

838
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:07,320
I think we need to test that and maybe that's about having, having another version that

839
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,320
has a repository of testimonials included and version that doesn't.

840
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,320
Oh yeah.

841
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,320
Yes.

842
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:14,820
Yes.

843
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,320
That makes any difference.

844
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:23,320
Now I think the, the data part, we, we get this back.

845
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,320
I need to look into it.

846
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,320
Yeah.

847
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,320
I think there's some insight there.

848
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:40,320
We'll, we'll have a look at that data from the app again and see if that's something

849
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,320
that we can use and it might give us information on websites that then you could add to your

850
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
scraping tool.

851
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:56,320
Um, and I think then we could look at structuring those responses and the, the main things.

852
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:06,320
So somebody asks a question, say, um, you know, can I get support or what support I

853
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
can get?

854
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:15,320
And then we probably need a breakdown of what the support is, why the support is relevant,

855
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,320
what they can get out of it, what the outcomes are, um, rather than just their query.

856
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,320
I think we can augment it to, to try and include those data in the response as well.

857
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
Yes.

858
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:37,320
And also now the chatbot, the end of chatbot, it will not ask, try, it will not try to ask,

859
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:44,320
like try to narrow down your, the, the, like if you are a man or woman.

860
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
Yeah.

861
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Yeah.

862
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,320
So the chatbot should narrow down.

863
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:57,320
But, but, but how deep should the chatbot ask?

864
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,320
Like I ask you if a man or woman.

865
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:06,320
And next question, do I need to ask your age range?

866
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:15,320
Like if a young male or old man, then you can ask more detailed question.

867
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,320
So how deep should the chatbot ask?

868
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:29,320
I think the only, the only significant difference there is whether they're a child or an adult.

869
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
Okay.

870
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,320
I don't think age would matter beyond that.

871
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
Okay.

872
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
Okay.

873
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,320
That's, that's easier.

874
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,320
Yeah.

875
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,320
You don't have to.

876
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,320
Yeah.

877
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,320
Okay.

878
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:48,320
Like on those websites that you're scraping, um, maybe it's worth trying to pick out tokens

879
01:05:48,320 --> 01:06:00,320
for, you know, gender or children versus adults and to try and use that to categorize or classify

880
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,320
some of the information and who it's relevant for.

881
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,320
And those could give you things then that might be follow-up prompts or things that

882
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:14,320
you can emphasize in the responses that, um, you know, if there's stuff that's just for

883
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:20,320
children, if there's stuff that, um, is for men specifically, then those could be things

884
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,320
that you could, yeah, bring out more in the responses.

885
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Okay.

886
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,320
Okay.

887
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:36,320
Then, um, do you mean like before I put these things into the knowledge base, I do these

888
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
things before?

889
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
Yeah.

890
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
Maybe.

891
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Like children or adults.

892
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
Yeah.

893
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,320
But that's, okay.

894
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:57,320
And then, okay, I will, um, try to find if some other project use this, this thing, because

895
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,320
from my understanding, like the ritual part, they should already do this.

896
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:17,320
Like if you said, I'm a, I'm a children, I'm a child, and this, uh, the embedding will,

897
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:26,320
will already trust from this sentence into like some number.

898
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:36,320
So the, the ritual part, we already try to find all the children part inside of the knowledge

899
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,320
base.

900
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Yeah.

901
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:51,320
So I don't need to do the classification because it will, for the retrieval, it's, it's already

902
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:59,320
to the classification because the embedded of children and out is definitely different.

903
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,320
Yeah.

904
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:07,320
I suppose what might be useful is if the retrieval part, cause if you ask a general question,

905
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:13,320
then you'll get lots of stuff returned in the retrieval part.

906
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,320
But if there's particular embeddings with what's returned, it seemed to be relevant

907
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:24,320
to those are things that probably should be accounted for in the response.

908
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,320
Even if that's to kind of say that some of this information is to do with children, some

909
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,320
of it is to do with adults.

910
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,320
Would you like to kind of, you know, enter it down or something like that.

911
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:43,320
So if there's embeddings and stuff that seemed prominent or relevant and they, those could

912
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,320
be the subject to follow up questions or.

913
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,320
Yeah.

914
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
That's, that's what I need to do.

915
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,320
The follow up questions part.

916
01:08:52,320 --> 01:09:03,320
Now I notice these recent models, they will always ask follow up questions.

917
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:11,320
But previously, let's say one years before, they don't ask these follow up questions.

918
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,320
Right.

919
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,320
So I think they, they, they also notice what you mentioned.

920
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:24,320
Like if they can narrow down the, the, the, the question, they can give better answers.

921
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Yeah.

922
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,320
Yeah.

923
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
Yeah.

924
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,320
Generally I think that was useful.

925
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,320
Did you find it useful?

926
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Yeah.

927
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,320
Yeah.

928
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
Okay.

929
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Great.

930
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,320
I need to incorporate in this.

931
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,320
Yeah.

932
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,320
Yeah.

933
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:47,320
Do you want to make some notes on the meeting after you've kind of listened to it back and

934
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,320
stuff and just put them on the.

935
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,320
Email or Notion?

936
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
Notion.

937
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,320
Yeah.

938
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
Okay.

939
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,320
Put them up there just cause it, it'd be useful just to kind of see those written down.

940
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,320
Yeah.

941
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,320
I think it's useful for my, the, the paper report.

942
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
Yeah.

943
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,320
Yeah.

944
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:16,320
Actually, I feel regret previously, we have so many meetings.

945
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,320
I, I didn't do some enough notes.

946
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,320
Oh, right.

947
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
Okay.

948
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Yeah.

949
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,320
Well, that was a good time to start.

950
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,320
I hope it's not too late.

951
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,320
Yeah.

952
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
Right.

953
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Yeah.

954
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,320
We'll leave it there cause I have to go.

955
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
Okay.

956
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:48,320
And we have a meeting in, so yeah, we need to put in a recurring meeting.

957
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Um, when would be useful for you to meet again?

958
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:02,320
Um, this week I'll be around on Wednesday, but otherwise it would be online.

959
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,320
So maybe if we go to next week.

960
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
But, but, but what's the point?

961
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
We meet like two days later.

962
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,320
Yeah.

963
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,320
That's another point as well.

964
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
I need to, yeah.

965
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
Yeah.

966
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,320
I got some time to consume all these.

967
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Should we go with next Thursday?

968
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Yeah.

969
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
Next Thursday I think.

970
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,320
I have one, almost two weeks.

971
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
Yeah.

972
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:30,320
So if I put a meeting in for 1.30.

973
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,320
Okay.

974
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,320
Okay.

975
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,320
I'll make that a recurring meeting as well.

976
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,320
So we don't just run into the same issue again.

977
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Oh, okay.
