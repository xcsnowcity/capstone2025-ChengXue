00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I've been thinking of this about, first of all, the people that don't come forward, what kind of information they'd like to know.

00:05.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, so that person that you're thinking of, you know, downloads this app or kind of gets it on their phone somehow,

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
what would the kind of question or how do you think they'd find out?

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, the first question that they would be asking is, what's out there, first of all?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
What's available for me if I was to leave home right now? Where can I go? Is there any place I can go?

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Then the second question would be, do the guards have to be notified if I go to that refuge?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Do tusla need to be, you know, if I go to that refuge?

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
These are all the kind of things that are going on and that's an awful lot that prevents people from coming forward.

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
So then, behind it, that's what they think of the children. What's available for the children out there if I don't want to come forward?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Do the schools have to be notified?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
All these things kind of keep coming, rambling around in their heads and that's what prevents them coming forward.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
If they had access to the information, as you say, not going through all these websites,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
you could put in what's available to me and something comes up into prayer, something comes up in Dublin.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
They're no good to anyone. They're no good to anyone.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
So having something like this is great but the kind of questions that they might be asking is,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
if I'm thinking now from a man's point of view, what's available?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
It's a lot of what's available to me. That's a lot of the stuff.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
What's available to me, how, what, when, where, why?

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
So how do I go about getting support? Do I need support? Why do I need this support?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
What's available for me? What's available for him? What's available for the kids?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
It's all about the what is before they go forward.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
So what, how do I, how do I…

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
How do I access support?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
How do I access support? Would that be…

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
That would be how do I access support?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And I'm living in wherever.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
What supports are available to me in?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Now I don't know how specific you can get in relation to that.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, well that's the task is to try and refine it as much as possible so that we do get accurate information.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
So how do I access support? What supports are out there?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
For me, my husband, who's a perpetrator of domestic violence, and then the children.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's a huge one.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
And then basically what other services need to be involved?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
So do they call the cards? Do all that kind of stuff?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
That's the kind of, that's what I'd know for that information to be about that.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
When you go in deep within, when you're talking about housing, social welfare, the finance side of things.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Like, what do I get on social welfare? I'm a single mother living with three children now.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
He was a sole earner. As a result, I've no income.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
If I leave him, what income would I have?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
So that could be links to say social welfare all over the areas. There would be a tie to certain things.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
They're also entitled to emergency deposits for apartments as well now, which is a great thing.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah. Which is huge.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah. And so if you think of it for her, and I'm thinking of the father that came in with the four kids in the car, knowing that there was no place for him, but was there any place for his kids?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
So are you talking about foster care or what are you talking about?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
And he goes, I don't have any information. What's foster care? Can I still be involved? Can I go to foster care?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
He did all this kind of stuff, but it was more about needed help with housing and he needed help with finance.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So questions would be there. How do I go about applying for social housing?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay. Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
That's the kind of, the more you get out of this, it'll be the how, the what, the when, the why.

03:51.000 --> 04:04.000
So if we start with how do I access support, say in Galway City, what kind of responses would you expect?

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
Are you giving your gender in that? Are you just being very specific, just what's available?

04:13.000 --> 04:24.000
So one thing that we can do is think of it as a conversation between the app and the person.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
And so if there's certain questions to ask the person in generating a response, then that's something that we can take into account as well.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
So if I was sitting in front of you saying I'm in domestic violence, what can you do for me?

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
So the very first thing we'll be talking about is, is it just harm or is it children?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Then we're talking about, are you willing to leave today? If you're willing to leave, we can take you from here and bring you to a place of safety.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Safety would need to be mentioned in this a lot.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Right.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Safety, the word safety, because that's what we're trying to push out there.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
So then what happens, it'll be kind of, so they're moved out, they're brought to Mowela, beside Galway, you'd want that to be mentioned.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Then when they're assigned what services are available to the children there and what services are available in the community.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
So there'll be a lot of stuff around that for the children.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
Then you go back to, if you remember the LGBTQI+, it keeps changing.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Is it LGBTQI+, or is it LGBTQ?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It keeps changing.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
But the members of the LGBT, what kind of supports are available for them? So you have a shout and you have a mock.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
That's what they'd want to get from this.

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
So they're specifically designed to support people that are going through domestic violence within that cohort of people as well.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm rambling here, am I?

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
No, no, no. I'm just trying to think of it as kind of an interaction in the app.

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
If somebody just types in the question, how do I access support in Galway City?

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Is there any point in giving them some answer to that at that point, or do you need follow-up questions?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
You need follow-up questions because you don't know what kind of support they're looking for.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, so you'd need them to tell you their gender.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, it would be nice because, like, Moella don't take males.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So they would need to know their gender.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But that wouldn't be straight away.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, it would have to be, because if you're a man, you're looking up to see a refuge center.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
He might show up to...

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
The other thing you often see with things like ChatGPT is that it'll give you a response,

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
and then it will say, if you'd like more specific information, tell them your gender or something like that.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, okay.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So it can kind of give a...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That'll probably make more sense, yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
...a bit of a response and then say, you know, yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
What they also...

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
What supports are available to the guards and the courts?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
So you're talking here about baron orders, protected orders, safety orders.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Hmm.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
They would need to be built in as well.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
So what kind of protective measures are out there for me if I come forward?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
That kind of way.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
If that makes sense.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So I suppose you just need to split them up into different categories, like...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
...you know, kind of...

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Like what we're doing with the act kind of way.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, we start with that support one and see what we get back, and then maybe we can

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
add some detail on gender and children and see...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Do you have some kind of way to set up here?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Can you just talk back to me, can I?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I can, yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Not sure.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Can you just kind of type or tell us what to type?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Just say, what supports are available to me?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
No, hang on.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
That...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Hang on, hang on.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Hang on, hang on.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Is it very short questions we ask?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Or is it free?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, it'd be...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, it's...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
It can be long-winded if they need to be.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, I'd just say, I'm a survivor of domestic violence.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
What supports are available to me?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Right.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Is it?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Do you wanna...

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Don't give it my type of day.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
I am a survivor...

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Of...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
No, what did I say now?

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
No, I think we can also like...

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
No, survivor, no.

08:48.000 --> 09:17.040
Let's see what goes back, maybe nothing In reality you'll probably get some people

09:17.080 --> 09:19.080
I'm getting a laugh actually

09:21.560 --> 09:27.600
But if I'm looking at that now gosh, that's bullshit in relation to can I scroll up there again, yeah

09:29.400 --> 09:31.400
It's still generating

09:32.360 --> 09:37.240
This one here on the right hand side is the kind of normal chat GPT

09:37.240 --> 09:43.640
Yeah, and the other one is the one that uses the stuff okay from the website. It's just the idea of

09:43.640 --> 09:51.360
Well, this is also from from everywhere USA UK yeah, I'll see

09:51.360 --> 09:56.000
Do you want to put it in Ireland? Sorry? I should have put that in the question. Should I know this is the one

09:57.800 --> 09:59.800
This is like for

10:00.760 --> 10:04.680
This will not show to the user, but now for for test, okay

10:05.360 --> 10:07.960
So what came up there then for Ireland sir?

10:08.880 --> 10:10.880
I'm sorry the one you're building

10:11.120 --> 10:13.600
Sir what supports came up?

10:25.680 --> 10:31.240
I think it didn't give anything. Okay. The question was a little bit

10:33.840 --> 10:36.480
Should be more like what refuges are available in glory

10:36.480 --> 10:38.480
I

10:39.280 --> 10:41.480
Should be about like what refuges are available

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
Possibly yeah, yeah

10:45.600 --> 10:49.280
Is that what you if somebody asked for what supports are available?

10:49.280 --> 10:55.000
Would you expect the refuges to come up like yeah, whatever? Yeah, you would you okay? Yeah

10:57.080 --> 11:05.000
It will need know your location right yeah, so okay, so like if the question is like this

11:06.480 --> 11:11.720
At least I need you I need to the chat bot should ask the user's location

11:12.360 --> 11:18.560
Okay before it give the answer. Is that correct? Yeah, I guess if it's enough it might be yeah

11:19.360 --> 11:21.360
location

11:21.920 --> 11:24.560
GPS but yeah, I mean for this example, maybe

11:26.800 --> 11:33.400
We should provide it explicitly in the in the question, let's say what refuges are available in goldway

11:34.400 --> 11:39.520
How big are you making this is this stick for nationwide or sir and I

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
Could be yeah

11:43.840 --> 11:48.100
Suppose it depends on access to it to relevant information

11:54.760 --> 11:59.080
That supports are available to me and go away maybe what refuges

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
I

12:05.400 --> 12:07.400
Say it's the running to me

12:08.640 --> 12:14.120
Is it okay, so don't just worry when you get it funny. Yeah, that's it. Okay

12:25.040 --> 12:31.480
Okay, she's looking up there no boy that's not there's a domestic violence response

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
But

12:40.080 --> 12:42.780
This it says there are 20

12:43.840 --> 12:49.340
It's still key didn't give you the space like to lose the gingerbread. Oh, yeah

12:52.920 --> 12:56.720
Yeah, shouldn't give the name of the areas push

12:59.520 --> 13:01.520
Is this a little bit around sir

13:02.520 --> 13:05.080
Yeah, but that would definitely be one as well depends on

13:06.640 --> 13:12.800
Their nature of their domestic violence relationship, but that actually would be there that would be in it as well. Sorry

13:21.760 --> 13:27.960
So these are the answer I should get in this robot this chatbot

13:27.960 --> 13:35.680
Where is Chuck Darragh from the refuge corporation record this chapter?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.440
So the woman's refuge I

13:39.920 --> 13:43.320
Said that this one doesn't tell us where the information was sourced from

13:43.320 --> 13:47.080
I guess the other one does because we've provided the information

13:48.200 --> 13:50.080
Women's Refuge

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
Corporation Road

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
I

14:14.720 --> 14:17.360
So this is the one if the

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
like

14:20.720 --> 14:25.340
The best model like like if I didn't give it any information

14:25.900 --> 14:31.460
Okay, this is all from their like original training data

14:32.100 --> 14:36.740
Okay. Yeah, so I want to improve their performance

14:37.260 --> 14:41.340
Okay, give the better more in detail information

14:43.620 --> 14:45.620
But here since

14:45.660 --> 14:49.740
It's just a prototype. Yes. Okay. I think it's

14:50.980 --> 14:52.980
Worse than this. Yes. Yes

14:55.340 --> 14:57.340
You

14:59.540 --> 15:02.540
Here I think cobra Louis

15:02.540 --> 15:25.700
So what's coming up here is better than what we have over here. But the main one is not

15:25.700 --> 15:31.740
there. Moetta is the first main point of contact that you would need if you're a female.

15:31.740 --> 15:36.860
You're looking for support. Wanting to leave the house with the children. It's the one

15:36.860 --> 15:43.380
thing that they always go for. And obviously there could be questions about Moetta as well.

15:43.380 --> 15:51.380
So where I can get the information? Moetta. You Google Moetta. That's how much you're looking

15:51.380 --> 16:03.060
for. Yeah, yeah. All the information that you require. Moetta. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e.

16:03.060 --> 16:30.780
Two words you said here. Cope. It's under cope. That's the main one for women. And then

16:30.780 --> 16:35.620
that takes the role of the children because they take the women and the children into

16:35.620 --> 16:40.100
the refuge. There's their own apartment on the side of the refuge, which is great. It's

16:40.100 --> 16:46.500
not communal spaces anymore. It's like an apartment block. So that is the most ideal

16:46.500 --> 16:52.500
one for the women. For the men, if you're asking what supports are available for men,

16:52.500 --> 16:58.420
they're very limited as we know. You'd be talking about Men's Network. But they're based

16:58.420 --> 17:05.860
in Waterford. But they cover the whole country through counselling. And they also offer legal

17:05.860 --> 17:14.060
support if needed, which is great. So if you're a father, you are going to be looking for

17:14.060 --> 17:18.060
the same things, like what's available for me out there. When I'm in domestic violence

17:18.060 --> 17:22.860
for five years, I've had enough. Can I get her out? How do I get her out of the house?

17:22.860 --> 17:27.940
So you're talking here about what are the orders? The courts. If you want to do that,

17:27.940 --> 17:33.700
just separate. As I said, supports, then maybe look at the finance. Housing is going to be

17:33.700 --> 17:39.740
huge. It's going to be huge anywhere. Massive. So I'd be kind of like stuff around having

17:39.740 --> 17:46.020
the same community there with a helpline, counter-council, having the, you know. Would

17:46.020 --> 17:50.180
this give websites, if you ask for it, could I get the website for a call with counter-council?

17:50.180 --> 17:56.820
Yeah. And then you get the social housing form. And then you have the, whatever kind

17:56.820 --> 18:04.100
of support the council can offer. Can I apply for a deposit for under the domestic violence

18:04.100 --> 18:08.940
provision? Yes, you can. How will they go about doing that? So you've got one section

18:08.940 --> 18:14.260
just on finance to include all that. So if Anto comes up on finance, on the question,

18:14.260 --> 18:20.780
it'll bring it straight to that section that should be developed in your letter. Yeah.

18:20.780 --> 18:29.660
Is, are the kind of answers to those questions, um, published in different places? Not really.

18:29.660 --> 18:37.780
Not really. No, not really. They say it's here, but here's the, here's the social, sorry,

18:37.780 --> 18:42.660
just the form of social housing, but yet you have to go to revenue. Yeah. And then you

18:42.660 --> 18:46.180
have to go and you have to get an affidavit signed and people get overwhelmed by that

18:46.180 --> 18:51.300
then. So it's about having the support that will help them go through that is what's needed.

18:51.300 --> 18:56.380
Unless they're well able to go themselves. But for the very start, when people are contacted

18:56.380 --> 19:03.420
and are using this, it is crisis management. Where can I go right now? It's quarter past

19:03.420 --> 19:08.140
one on a Friday. I need to get the hell out of here before he comes home. Where do I go?

19:08.140 --> 19:13.380
What's this? Oh, Pops Moella. They contact Moella. Are you safe or do we need to contact

19:13.380 --> 19:18.660
the guards to bring you here? Yeah. That's the question that will come back to me. But

19:18.660 --> 19:27.180
what you just want for the, for this is to give them information on Moella. Yeah. What's

19:27.180 --> 19:51.660
this query? I just asked. I'm a man. Where can I go?

19:51.660 --> 20:01.820
So before this, I want to know like these, like basic answers. Are they accurate? Yes.

20:01.820 --> 20:07.100
That's correct. Go around crisis. Okay. I haven't heard of transgender quality network

20:07.100 --> 20:15.460
Ireland. So it says a service to people in Galway, but they must exist somewhere. But

20:15.460 --> 20:26.500
there's a lot of stuff that's stable. It's fairly. No, none of that. None of that. All

20:26.500 --> 20:33.220
that. No. Okay. So you would take a one. Yes. 100%. Call your rape crisis. Definitely would

20:33.220 --> 20:40.420
be involved in that. Okay. Yeah. They would be kind of providing counseling at a later

20:40.420 --> 20:51.140
stage more so than after family leave. That's the direction. So one, I think one problems

20:51.140 --> 20:57.780
may, maybe the, the, the, the base model is sometimes they, they, they cannot give you

20:57.780 --> 21:04.060
the accurate information. And I think in this situation, the, the accuracy is important.

21:04.060 --> 21:15.860
So yeah, but, so I thought maybe, no, I mean, in my chatbot, sometimes the, they cannot

21:15.860 --> 21:24.980
find the information, but at least I need to make sure the accuracy of the information.

21:24.980 --> 21:44.500
And wait a sec. Where's the, where's my, where's my, the, the question I'm a man. Okay. Here.

21:44.500 --> 21:54.060
So another thing is you mentioned the, like the, when, when people ask for support, like

21:54.060 --> 22:02.740
the house finance, all this stuff, do, do you, do you mean then in this chatbot, it,

22:02.740 --> 22:09.200
it doesn't need to give you this instructions. It only need to give you the information where

22:09.200 --> 22:25.400
you can find the, where you need to go, where you need to go. Okay. Do you want to try one

22:25.400 --> 22:35.000
of it? The children, something like I've got two children, what supports are available

22:35.000 --> 23:00.200
for them? Where should I go? What can I get? What, what support can I, can they get? For

23:30.200 --> 23:37.960
example, you know, it's going into, it's coming into stuff like, you know, 10 GP services.

23:37.960 --> 23:45.080
That's kind of straightforward enough really. Um, free counseling services. Okay. I should

23:45.080 --> 24:00.000
be looking at your one over here. Should I? Oh, okay. You'd expect rainbows to be coming

24:00.000 --> 24:04.640
up there now. They're, they're a national organization as well, but that's their own

24:04.640 --> 24:09.040
bereavement. But it's a bit, it's also about lots of parents, even though it doesn't have

24:09.040 --> 24:14.800
to be bereaved or separated. They're going to be separated as a result of this. So that

24:14.800 --> 24:19.040
would be one support that would come up. And it's a national organization. Should you just

24:19.040 --> 24:29.400
put in rainbows? They're their rainbows, Ireland. So they're based all over the country. Okay.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.720
It would be a good support for, now you have to be six months separated or six months before

24:33.720 --> 24:38.640
you can go on and put their rain all over the place. But it is a good support for, for

24:38.640 --> 24:43.440
children because it's specifically designed for, as I said, breach or separate parents.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.760
Okay. The only difference is if you're in a group you're never put in with a group who's

24:47.760 --> 24:52.760
separated if you're, with your parents bereaved. Okay. Obviously. So you're definitely getting

24:52.760 --> 24:57.000
the one to one support and those groups are very small, doing it in around three. Okay.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.560
It's going to be 54 or 55 kids in the evening, so only three in it. It's a great service

25:02.560 --> 25:06.400
to have. It would be a service that parents would be looking for, but not for our parents

25:06.400 --> 25:14.600
would know about it. Right. Okay. Yeah. So that would be one kind of aspect. Yeah. So

25:14.600 --> 25:21.240
is there a rainbows program in Galway? I thought it was a voice recognition thing as well.

25:21.240 --> 25:34.480
I haven't tried, I haven't tried. Oh, sorry. Is there, sorry. I get lazy. Is there a rainbows

25:34.480 --> 25:57.800
program in Galway? What? Thank you. Good.

26:27.800 --> 26:41.760
Where does it start again? There. The once more, yeah. See the rainbows Ireland program

26:41.760 --> 26:46.280
for children who have experienced death and force or other fabric changes. Okay. That's

26:46.280 --> 26:51.240
all there. Yeah. We're talking about complaints and Brussels and all that kind of stuff. To

26:51.240 --> 26:58.400
you. So it would be the main one here. Definitely there. He just, he never heard of that service

26:58.400 --> 27:05.520
club and clinic or that and it's going down into what you watch. We'd have both local

27:05.520 --> 27:13.120
schools and communities and just go ahead and pay agency. I assume kind of shorter responses

27:13.120 --> 27:21.120
or more of what people would be after to the point. If you think that if you're in a crisis

27:21.160 --> 27:27.200
where the fuck can I go? Yeah. And like, you know, is he going to follow me? Yeah. How

27:27.200 --> 27:33.480
do I get there? Yeah. Yeah. Should it be taxi numbers? Can I get a taxi? Can you book a

27:33.480 --> 27:38.560
taxi from this? Yeah. Yeah. You know, if you get to my wallet, I'd actually pay for your

27:38.560 --> 27:42.920
taxi if you didn't want to pay for the taxi. Okay. It's a great service. Like if you're

27:42.920 --> 27:50.040
living out in that really like if you're over kind of is where that lady was from was Glinsk.

27:50.040 --> 27:54.880
There's nothing, no taxes over there. So we had to bring her from Glinsk into Mowell

27:54.880 --> 28:02.280
and Galway with six kids. That was a fun drive. Yeah. Cause kids wanted to be with Bellamy

28:02.280 --> 28:10.920
and the car. Of course. So seven seater kids. Yeah. One extra overload. Overload. Yeah. Needs

28:10.920 --> 28:19.920
most. Yeah. Needs most. Yeah, exactly. Squad car going ahead of us. Yeah. So some of these

28:19.920 --> 28:24.480
things are good. Some of them are. It's really giving you a lot of information to find out

28:24.480 --> 28:28.080
the rainbows for a lot of direct wind contact. Local, you're not going to be contacted. There's

28:28.080 --> 28:37.240
no, I, in my knowledge base, there's no information about this website. So it didn't give anything.

28:37.240 --> 28:46.160
Okay. All right. Is there any kind of testimonials, something like testimonials that would exist

28:46.160 --> 28:52.320
where victims would describe the actual, you know, the fact that I went to Mowella because,

28:52.320 --> 28:57.400
and they helped me with XYZ. As I said to you, I emailed to Mowella to give me a few

28:57.400 --> 29:04.920
testimonials and they never got back to me. Okay. Yeah. So I think it's, it's that kind

29:04.920 --> 29:13.240
of, I see the testimonials as a place where it puts all of the stuff, the reason why things

29:13.240 --> 29:21.080
are done together and it kind of puts relevant stuff together. And that's all stuff that is

29:21.080 --> 29:27.200
something that a model like this could pick up on and use. So kind of joining the dots rather

29:27.200 --> 29:33.120
than just a directory of information, but you don't really know why you need that stuff. So I

29:33.120 --> 29:42.480
think to make it more useful, something like those would be good. I mean, the only other thing I can

29:42.520 --> 29:48.040
think of beyond that is like if we sat down and did an interview with you and transcribed the

29:48.040 --> 29:51.680
whole thing where you're talking through these things, but that's something then that could

29:51.680 --> 30:01.000
probably go out on a date and that sort of thing. But it's this, I think the thing that's hard to,

30:01.000 --> 30:11.360
to get at is, you know, you would do this because, and this will help you with XYZ. And when you do

30:11.360 --> 30:17.240
that, you might do this kind of connecting it to come up with a, you know, a plan or something

30:17.240 --> 30:22.760
that's relevant for a particular, someone's particular situation. Well, it's, it's, it's,

30:22.760 --> 30:30.160
it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a very basic enough, right? You would go to a refuge, which

30:30.160 --> 30:34.760
your kids, and they try and locate you in a different area, get the court system behind you,

30:34.760 --> 30:39.320
get a baron orders, that guy can go near them for five years. That's the kind of it. And they're

30:39.320 --> 30:44.240
happy with that. And that's 100%. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. Because they only have a two year old

30:44.240 --> 30:48.400
and don't be seven. You know, you have a 12 year old and there's an older 17. Yeah. So

30:48.400 --> 30:53.760
self determinate all that kind of stuff themselves. But that's really what they want. That's where

30:53.760 --> 30:59.240
can I go? Where am I safe? Where are the kids safe? Yeah. Like, I can't imagine you use this

30:59.240 --> 31:04.720
when you're post after that. When you're say, when you're inside, are you going to go look

31:04.720 --> 31:09.720
for this again? Housing is a great idea. But I'll go back to the chatbot again and see, can they

31:09.720 --> 31:14.800
give me information on housing? Whereas citizens information, I'm not, not by any means. It's

31:14.800 --> 31:20.800
great. I'm just trying to give the idea like a success story or this it's basic enough of what

31:20.800 --> 31:26.120
the success will be. Yeah. It's very easy to say it. But the reality is I'm trying to find a house

31:26.120 --> 31:30.000
for someone to move into. Yeah, it's very difficult. And then you talk about the schools,

31:30.640 --> 31:37.360
changing our schools, how to change the schools, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So like,

31:37.360 --> 31:41.560
whatever it is that you're trying to get from this, is it to give it to me as much information

31:41.560 --> 31:46.600
as possible, then that will become overpowering to me. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know, so even like,

31:46.600 --> 31:53.040
give me four or five of the top ones will be ideal. Yeah. So what we're trying to understand

31:53.040 --> 31:59.400
is what would be useful to get out of it. And then how can we tweak it so that it does

32:00.200 --> 32:05.680
produce that. So in a way, we're trying to get in the heads of somebody who would be using it. And,

32:05.680 --> 32:15.760
you know, in some ways, it's probably about making sure that the answers to their questions

32:15.760 --> 32:21.640
are accurate. But then there's probably other roles that could have like, like, if there's

32:21.640 --> 32:28.000
stuff that they, you know, hadn't thought about asking, but would be useful for them to know,

32:28.000 --> 32:35.560
at this point in their kind of situation, then the chatbot can provide information on those

32:35.560 --> 32:42.720
things as well and give them a sense of what that journey ahead might look like to, I suppose,

32:42.720 --> 32:47.280
illustrate that, you know, there's a way out of it. Yeah. That's what the testimonials were

32:47.280 --> 32:56.880
probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. So, so I think what would you like to have from the

32:56.880 --> 33:08.480
testimonials? What kind of, um, so rather than doing an interview now with people, what would be

33:08.480 --> 33:20.240
I, uh, this is, this is all kind of based on what I think would be useful. It doesn't necessarily

33:20.240 --> 33:31.600
mean it would be, but, um, from, from, from what I think the testimonials could describe someone's

33:31.600 --> 33:40.040
situation that they found themselves in, um, and describe their journey or their path to getting

33:40.040 --> 33:48.240
support, things that worked well, things that didn't. And if you had enough of those, um, then,

33:48.240 --> 33:56.200
uh, and you were able to provide them to something like this, then it would be able to pick the bits

33:56.200 --> 34:00.640
that are relevant from different ones to find the ones that are relevant to a particular person's

34:00.640 --> 34:09.920
situation and to use those to generate a response. So it's a man with children who, um, is in some

34:09.920 --> 34:15.040
particular situation and there might be, if you had like a few different testimonials that kind of

34:15.040 --> 34:20.880
match that, um, then there might be some say in the right location. And so you might be able to

34:20.880 --> 34:28.320
kind of pick bits from them to kind of kind of frame your answer based on that frame, you know,

34:28.320 --> 34:38.480
someone's experiences rather than, um, cause I think it's in that way, it's, it would allow you

34:38.480 --> 34:47.920
to provide responses that, um, don't just present a particular service in isolation, but it's more

34:47.920 --> 34:53.840
presenting it that in a way that, you know, you might need this, this and this because somebody

34:53.840 --> 34:58.320
else did and found those useful and they were in a similar situation to you, which you wouldn't get

34:58.320 --> 35:03.440
from any of those individual websites, but you get it because this person experienced that and that

35:03.440 --> 35:11.280
worked for them. So it's the testimonials for me provide a way of linking different services, um,

35:11.280 --> 35:18.160
to provide a useful journey for somebody out of that situation. Okay. I should have written down

35:18.160 --> 35:29.360
that. You can give me a transcript of that. I actually could get you a few testimonials from

35:29.360 --> 35:34.800
our case that are open to us at the moment. They're coming towards the end of it. Right. But

35:34.800 --> 35:42.080
if you could type up those questions that you just said there, I can run that by them. Yeah.

35:42.080 --> 35:46.320
Yeah. Definitely get four testimonials. Anyway, like one will talk for Ireland, like, you know,

35:47.200 --> 35:52.000
yeah. Or she's good. If that's what you want, that's what's needed. What do you think would be

35:52.000 --> 36:01.520
useful? Uh, the thing you said, the testimonial part, does that mean, uh, I need to, the chatbot

36:01.520 --> 36:08.640
need to ask the user a lot of information. Possibly, yeah. But will the user willing to

36:08.640 --> 36:15.760
type so many things? It's like almost like type, uh, all the

36:18.240 --> 36:25.200
story. Well, I'm thinking that you might get at something like the, um, chatbot might say,

36:26.080 --> 36:34.240
um, yes, we have various different organizations that offer support. Some of these are specific to

36:34.240 --> 36:40.000
men. Some are specific to, to women. Um, if you'd like more detail on any of these,

36:40.000 --> 36:44.640
let me know if you're a man or a woman, I might just type man. And then I might go into more

36:44.640 --> 36:54.800
detail on this. And all of that is forming an interaction then that, um, the, obviously the

36:54.800 --> 37:00.240
way that these work is that pre the previous conversation is taken into account in any

37:00.240 --> 37:05.920
responses. So they've already declared they're a man and other answers could take that into

37:05.920 --> 37:11.920
account as well. So you need to keep restating the situation, but it's more like with a support

37:11.920 --> 37:17.920
worker, they would develop an understanding over time and only, uh, present stuff that's relevant.

37:20.960 --> 37:26.400
If you were to get testimonials like that, and that was your main source of data, you'd probably

37:26.400 --> 37:32.320
need a lot of them, wouldn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably the limiting factor here is that,

37:32.800 --> 37:37.600
um, unless there there's a good source and it's readily available,

37:39.200 --> 37:43.920
it's probably unrealistic to ask you to produce the event you would need to come up with any kind

37:43.920 --> 37:53.920
of good answers to it. So, um, in that case, we'd, we'd need to try and I suppose just make best use

37:53.920 --> 38:07.440
of the stuff that is available. Um, yeah. Um, yeah. So, um, the information part is definitely

38:07.440 --> 38:17.440
need to improve the, you said the testimony part, uh, if they're just like, not, I don't,

38:17.440 --> 38:26.400
I don't get so many data should I still use this? Well, one thing we could think about doing is to

38:27.600 --> 38:37.280
kind of think about it as a, as a kind of a feasibility or, um, uh, of the tool for maybe

38:37.280 --> 38:44.320
one particular user group. So we could try and get like, I don't know, 10 testimonials or something

38:44.320 --> 38:53.280
that are all from people in a similar area or maybe similar gender, and then just, um,

38:53.280 --> 38:59.440
kind of test whether or not if we were playing the part of somebody in a similar role,

38:59.440 --> 39:05.680
would we get better responses if we had those testimonials available? Um, and that would just

39:05.680 --> 39:11.120
allow us to kind of, yeah, test whether that testimonial approach would be something that was

39:11.120 --> 39:15.760
worth pursuing if we did have resources to do that or whether, you know, the responses

39:15.760 --> 39:23.600
actually aren't much better if you do have that data. Um, that could be one, one, um, way to go.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.560
The localization of things is, is another important aspects. Yeah.

39:34.880 --> 39:41.760
So that's something to think about. How, how do you do that?

39:42.560 --> 39:46.240
Is that something that can be picked up in the scraping or is it something that

39:46.240 --> 39:49.520
would need someone to manually tie things that

39:53.600 --> 39:59.360
if I ask us about an action rather than just what's available. So how do I get support?

39:59.360 --> 40:10.480
Hmm. The other thing with a testimonial as well is it would probably include things like multiple

40:10.480 --> 40:17.040
factors like housing, finance, children, that sort of thing that the chatbot could use to

40:17.040 --> 40:23.600
structure answers and say, um, here's areas that people commonly need to consider. Is there any

40:23.600 --> 40:30.480
of these that you would, um, you know, well, that's all good. It's all the finance stuff

40:30.480 --> 40:36.640
there and all that. Don't know how much we're just getting it all from, but just go up again.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.720
I think the format is broken or something. Where's my question?

40:42.960 --> 40:47.600
How do I get support? So it's telling me there about immediate safety. It's the contact

40:47.600 --> 40:53.600
guardians, other ones, domestic violence service, seek refuge in shelter. That's all there.

40:54.880 --> 40:59.120
Haven though, if you're homeless or need emergency, the Haven can provide shelter.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.240
The Haven. Never heard that in Galway is it? Yeah.

41:07.840 --> 41:15.120
It's Haven Galway. H-A-V-E-N. I'm going to address here Boundary Avenue.

41:15.840 --> 41:20.080
It's an apartment that you can rent at booking.com.

41:25.120 --> 41:31.120
It's a apartment? One Boundary Avenue.

41:31.120 --> 41:45.760
Meals are in Project Burger, Car of Haven, Family Hope.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.120
Chop Car of Day Center.

41:53.120 --> 42:05.760
There's Car of Haven, Family Hope, and that's what it's referred to.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.240
But again, that's not much use to you if... No.

42:11.840 --> 42:18.720
This is going to react to all the legal advice. That's actually not bad. If you ask actions

42:19.360 --> 42:25.840
rather than give me, you get more of a... So what was your restaurant there?

42:25.840 --> 42:29.680
I just asked, how do I get support? How? How? Okay.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.160
Rather than what's available, you're going to get everything.

42:39.840 --> 42:45.200
There's a few sites that we've come across. How do I go to refuge?

42:45.200 --> 42:50.640
Pretty straightforward. I don't see why they'll give me that.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.720
They'll tell you why you would go to a refuge.

43:02.320 --> 43:06.160
That's actually a good question as well. Why would I go to a refuge?

43:06.160 --> 43:11.040
I'm just going to put it out to the loo for a second.

43:13.280 --> 43:13.680
Sorry.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.000
There's a lot of information which is generated for that one.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.040
I'm not destroying it now.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.920
Is this perhaps a PhD for you, or is it a master's or...

43:37.920 --> 43:40.960
Master. In artificial intelligence, is it?

43:41.520 --> 43:42.160
In what?

43:42.160 --> 43:42.960
Artific... AI?

43:43.520 --> 43:49.200
No, it's data analytics. It's very similar to AI. We have a lot of same class.

43:49.200 --> 43:49.600
Okay.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.100
Yeah.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.440
This is law school overnight now.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.400
It's never stopped.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.280
Can I stop it?

44:00.000 --> 44:04.400
Yeah. Is something wrong happened?

44:07.760 --> 44:09.280
Right. It's some...

44:11.760 --> 44:16.080
There are not some meaningful words?

44:16.080 --> 44:16.320
No.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.200
No meaningful?

44:17.200 --> 44:17.920
No.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.680
Okay. Something is wrong here.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.320
Oh, come on.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.280
I think something is wrong here.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.880
I think it's in your loop, the software.

44:40.880 --> 44:50.160
I cannot hear.

44:50.160 --> 44:54.960
Okay. The website is in freeze, I think.

45:00.960 --> 45:05.280
Okay. I killed the website, totally.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.160
Okay. This is the...

45:17.280 --> 45:18.800
You okay for talking to me, man?

45:18.800 --> 45:19.360
Yeah, I'm okay.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.920
The best model, there's something wrong in the best model.

45:34.880 --> 45:40.400
It's... Continue to give all the nonsense words.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.480
All right. Okay. Yeah.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.880
I don't know what's wrong here. See?

45:47.680 --> 45:48.320
Right. Okay.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.520
It's even freeze the web page.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.760
Okay. What's the question you asked?

45:55.760 --> 45:56.880
What was the question?

45:56.880 --> 46:07.680
How do I go to a refuge here?

46:07.680 --> 46:08.560
Maybe a typo?

46:09.120 --> 46:13.120
No, but here my rag for this is good.

46:13.120 --> 46:19.040
Okay. In terms of the...

46:20.720 --> 46:25.280
You mentioned those things that you would want to know for each thing.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.880
It was the... How? What?

46:29.840 --> 46:32.320
The with the why. That's the best of the first in those questions.

46:33.360 --> 46:33.680
Right.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.200
Something very short and snappy.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.720
How do I go to a refuge?

46:36.720 --> 46:38.960
What's available to me in a refuge?

46:38.960 --> 46:40.560
Where do I get counselling?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.760
Tell them that's it. Where would I get counselling?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.640
So you get everything here now again.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.680
How do you spell counselling?

46:49.680 --> 46:50.480
C-O-U-N.

46:50.480 --> 46:53.600
C-O-U-N.

47:03.360 --> 47:10.400
Because we can ask the model to provide answers in particular formats as well.

47:10.400 --> 47:19.040
So if the why or whatever was always important, then you could incorporate that into the responses.

47:19.040 --> 47:25.200
And maybe that's something that is worth doing because everything you suggest,

47:27.840 --> 47:30.560
somebody would probably want an explanation to...

47:32.400 --> 47:35.120
Why would they do that in the first place and what would they get out of it?

47:37.040 --> 47:43.760
So knowing what they would want from those responses will help us structure things better.

47:49.040 --> 47:53.200
Where do I get counselling?

47:59.040 --> 48:03.440
Okay, this is the first time the body is quicker than this one.

48:04.880 --> 48:10.000
Oh no, I think it's the incident situation again.

48:10.960 --> 48:11.760
It won't stop.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.720
I think there's some bug there.

48:19.040 --> 48:22.720
It won't stop.

48:24.480 --> 48:31.440
And then the page freeze.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.920
So what's your in-project look like here?

48:44.800 --> 48:58.240
So, if we get this to a state where it's providing sufficient answers,

49:00.160 --> 49:04.160
your end product could take different forms.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.520
It could be something on a website, it could be something in a mobile app.

49:08.400 --> 49:16.640
So the end product, as I imagine it is, it's a mobile app that you can use in discrete mode.

49:16.640 --> 49:20.880
And it's just a simple interface like this.

49:20.880 --> 49:26.160
You ask questions, but it provides all of the information that you would get from

49:28.160 --> 49:33.200
the kind of app that we were looking at before, but it provides it in a way that

49:33.440 --> 49:38.800
makes the information easier to access.

49:38.800 --> 49:43.760
But also, one thing that we talked about is that depending on the situation of the person,

49:43.760 --> 49:50.480
you could customize the way what information is presented and what's not.

49:52.160 --> 49:56.560
The bot can do that as well.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.280
It can customize things to people's situations.

50:00.160 --> 50:08.160
Rather than being kind of clunky that it just reorders boxes to show you what information.

50:08.160 --> 50:14.160
I see that as stuff that keeps popping up here in relation to physical abuse.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.880
It's more about just coercive control.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.960
That's the main thing about domestic violence.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.520
How do I know that I'm in a coercive control relationship?

50:21.520 --> 50:34.640
No, I mean, I feel it's something wrong in my program.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.400
Oh, I forgot again.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.840
No, they're okay.

50:40.880 --> 50:44.000
No, it can never stop now.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.600
It's like in a loop or something.

50:47.520 --> 50:50.320
They actually gave good information at the start of that.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.200
Yeah, yes.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.040
They did actually give good information.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.400
I don't know that lady.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.840
She rang and it was me.

50:57.840 --> 50:58.720
She was contacted.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.240
She rang me.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.840
It was quarter past four on a Tuesday evening.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.400
She rang me.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.160
She said she'd been looking up.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.400
She said she could all have kept coming up with Tuesday.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.760
So she wouldn't give her name.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.440
She wouldn't give her kids names or nothing.

51:13.440 --> 51:17.120
She wouldn't know what is available for her right now.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.120
He's not home till 8 o'clock this evening.

51:19.120 --> 51:19.760
He's at work.

51:20.640 --> 51:21.760
She says, I'm sitting here.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.480
My two guys are bleeding and he's after hitting one of the children.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.600
I don't want to stand by that.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.680
I need to get out of here.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.280
Do I call the guards or who do I call?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.760
I said, well, are you safe when he comes home?

51:31.760 --> 51:32.960
So I know she says I'm petrified.

51:33.760 --> 51:34.960
I said, have you anywhere to go?

51:34.960 --> 51:35.680
She said, no.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.280
Do you want me to create a place for you to go?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.120
And then I told her about Moila.

51:39.120 --> 51:39.760
What's Moila?

51:39.760 --> 51:41.520
I said, well, look, we've got four hours.

51:41.520 --> 51:44.320
Do you want to have a look at Moila on the website yourself and see what you think?

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
She still wouldn't give me her name or address or anything.

51:47.040 --> 51:47.760
So she went off.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.960
She looked at Moila.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.160
I told her, I'm going to stay on the phone because I wouldn't let her go.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.960
So she got back and she goes, that's where I need to go.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.480
Can you make that happen?

51:57.360 --> 52:01.040
I said, I can't, but give me a minute to make sure there's a bed available for you.

52:01.040 --> 52:01.520
Yeah.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.040
And there were random, there was.

52:03.680 --> 52:07.360
And then basically they said, we're going to contact the guards.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.840
I said, well, I don't even see no dates.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.080
She doesn't want to give me anything because she hears I'm too slow.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.960
But yeah, she's going to, she arranged, she arranged.

52:14.960 --> 52:18.640
She met me at the local center shop over in Winhamstown.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.800
A very small little dinky shop.

52:20.800 --> 52:26.880
And there she was herself, just the children and their suitcases at the side of the road

52:26.880 --> 52:30.880
waiting to know if I got a puncture or God forbid anything happened, you know,

52:31.520 --> 52:35.760
but pick them up, brought them in and still wouldn't give me her name.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.440
But she wasn't from Glynamada.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.880
She got texted to Glynamada.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.320
She was from Glyn.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.720
I found out afterwards.

52:42.720 --> 52:47.200
So yeah, so now she's, she's open to our service and she will answer any of those.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.120
But she said, I just needed to get out.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.880
I didn't care where I went.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.840
I just needed to get out.

52:52.640 --> 52:57.200
And then when you're in a place of safety, then all of the other stuff starts coming in.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.240
Eventually I feel safe here.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.120
This is what I want.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.400
How do I remain keeping myself safe?

53:04.400 --> 53:05.440
Yeah, yeah.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.600
Do I get support to go to court?

53:07.600 --> 53:09.520
Who helps me if I go to court?

53:09.520 --> 53:10.160
Yeah.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.080
Do, how do I access legal aid?

53:13.040 --> 53:17.200
There is, I know that you're kind of saying you want more of an interface kind of thing,

53:17.200 --> 53:20.880
but it is a lot of people would be asked to direct questions.

53:21.440 --> 53:24.640
Like, as I said, they're like, how do I access legal aid?

53:24.640 --> 53:25.440
Yeah, yeah.

53:26.320 --> 53:26.560
Yeah.

53:27.520 --> 53:31.200
That's not what you're, I know that we're kind of coming at it from different angles.

53:31.200 --> 53:36.080
No, that is what we're trying to find out is what would people want to ask?

53:36.080 --> 53:36.560
Yeah.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.000
What they want responses for.

53:38.000 --> 53:44.640
So like a lot of my ideas for what it would look like come from my limited understanding

53:44.640 --> 53:47.760
from just working on the last project.

53:47.760 --> 53:54.000
So we're trying to come to a better understanding of, you know, what it should look like and

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
how people would want to interact with it.

53:56.640 --> 54:00.320
And then the kind of results that they would really need to get back

54:00.320 --> 54:02.320
from it that would be most relevant.

54:02.320 --> 54:06.720
I think it'd be very good at the very start to get them to a place where they're safe.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.680
Then they'd forget about it until they want to move on.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.400
Yeah.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.720
And then that's when they'll come back and help me the first time,

54:12.720 --> 54:13.920
they might help me this time.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.800
Yeah, yeah.

54:15.600 --> 54:18.320
So getting them to a place where they're safe.

54:18.320 --> 54:18.640
Yes.

54:18.640 --> 54:19.760
Is that the primary?

54:19.760 --> 54:20.720
That's the main thing.

54:20.720 --> 54:23.920
That's the main thing and the main reason for this as well.

54:23.920 --> 54:24.240
Yeah.

54:24.240 --> 54:24.960
Okay.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.320
Where they feel safe.

54:26.320 --> 54:33.040
And you came up with some websites that we hadn't come across before, but is there like a

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
a list of even just for Galway and people that you would deal with,

54:40.640 --> 54:44.480
is there like a list of websites or organizations?

54:44.480 --> 54:47.920
Oh yes, I came in with lots of them.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.120
You wrote some of his papers.

54:49.120 --> 54:49.600
Yeah, yeah.

54:50.320 --> 54:54.480
Tell me what you want and what I can get for you and we'll see where we can go from there.

55:02.240 --> 55:02.800
Websites.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.480
I've never heard of that Carb Haven Family Hub now.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.440
Is that a residential place?

55:14.880 --> 55:15.600
Carb Haven.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.480
Supported temporary accommodation.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.200
Ten families experience homelessness in Galway City.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.160
Oh, it's homelessness.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.720
That's that domestic violence relation to the club.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.480
Unless I suppose you're homeless as a result.

55:30.480 --> 55:30.880
Okay.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.520
Okay.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.080
We started to get in there nowadays.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.120
It's awful.

55:42.160 --> 55:48.320
When you see the the care and then when you're a male, the one question I said,

55:48.320 --> 55:51.280
I ignore would you prefer a female staff member to come collect you?

55:52.800 --> 55:53.360
Yeah, so.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.600
This is a great thing.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.600
If you get lost growing, you'll be nervous.

55:59.680 --> 56:06.800
Yeah, so really it's a chatbot and you know we're using it here on a laptop and

56:07.680 --> 56:13.520
you know if we got it in a position that it was useful, you could embed it in anything.

56:13.520 --> 56:18.800
So, you know, if you thought it was a good idea to turn it into an app once we've

56:19.360 --> 56:21.760
got something that doesn't have everything.

56:21.760 --> 56:22.880
We even have the server though.

56:22.880 --> 56:23.280
Yeah.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.240
But we'll shake it out.

56:24.560 --> 56:25.060
Yeah.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.640
We have that for the whole server.

56:28.640 --> 56:29.680
I didn't get the server.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.880
That thing I sent out to you wasn't your completion.

56:38.000 --> 56:38.720
Don't see this.

56:38.720 --> 56:42.400
The answer since that's a sit on to you as well.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.880
I didn't go into the code myself.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.840
I couldn't even do where to go with that.

56:49.360 --> 56:49.600
Yeah.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.240
It was it was complete.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.200
It was completed.

56:53.200 --> 56:53.920
Yeah.

56:54.880 --> 57:00.560
Two little things that you had to finish and then that's what it all does well.

57:00.560 --> 57:02.240
I was disappointed how that ended up.

57:02.240 --> 57:02.740
Yeah.

57:08.160 --> 57:14.240
Okay, so is there anything, so I think a list of websites that we obviously haven't included.

57:14.240 --> 57:17.840
Yeah, or maybe like some PDF file.

57:18.720 --> 57:23.680
But like the store this information.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.420
No, no.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.080
The website is now.

57:31.120 --> 57:34.080
No, I mean, because like you can scrape it once you have two websites.

57:34.080 --> 57:34.640
Yeah, yeah.

57:34.640 --> 57:42.080
I mean, this information are all from the website.

57:42.160 --> 57:51.680
I mean, if they are all if they some of them also like some PDF file, some like legal file, some.

57:52.880 --> 57:57.520
So so like documents that you might provide people with information, is it?

57:58.640 --> 58:03.440
No, I mean, like the government will have some documents.

58:04.000 --> 58:04.500
Okay.

58:04.980 --> 58:08.340
No documents about these things.

58:09.300 --> 58:11.940
Like, do I need that?

58:12.820 --> 58:17.780
Do I need to extract information from that?

58:18.820 --> 58:24.500
So I'm thinking just there's a lot of stuff on the app that you could pull from it.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.420
There was a lot of good information that was on that.

58:27.140 --> 58:27.540
Yeah.

58:27.540 --> 58:29.220
If you can open the code, I don't know.

58:30.020 --> 58:32.100
Yeah, that's your baby.

58:32.100 --> 58:32.600
Yeah.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.320
There was a question sent you that already.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.520
The previous app had a database.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.080
Yeah, yeah.

58:41.080 --> 58:41.580
Yeah.

58:41.960 --> 58:45.000
There was a lot of information on that that would fit into that as well.

58:45.560 --> 58:46.060
Yeah.

58:46.120 --> 58:46.620
Yeah.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.340
Okay.

58:48.520 --> 58:50.200
So yeah, that's that's something that.

58:50.200 --> 58:50.700
Yeah.

58:51.960 --> 58:56.280
Even the headings of it, if you create just a question around the headings that were on it.

58:56.920 --> 58:57.420
Yeah.

58:57.900 --> 59:01.020
I think we have a list of all those are broken down.

59:01.740 --> 59:02.780
That's where it is.

59:02.780 --> 59:03.280
Yeah.

59:03.280 --> 59:06.540
All the websites associated with each and they're broken down.

59:08.540 --> 59:09.040
There.

59:09.260 --> 59:10.140
That's where they are.

59:10.140 --> 59:10.640
Yeah.

59:11.340 --> 59:11.840
Yeah.

59:13.340 --> 59:14.540
I'll have a look at that again.

59:14.540 --> 59:15.040
Yeah.

59:15.580 --> 59:18.220
That's what it says to me for doing there.

59:18.220 --> 59:18.940
It's there.

59:18.940 --> 59:19.440
Yeah.

59:19.660 --> 59:20.160
Okay.

59:20.300 --> 59:20.800
Yeah.

59:21.180 --> 59:23.660
I just broke it down sections or the housing sections.

59:24.540 --> 59:25.040
Yeah.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.960
There's a lot of contact details over there with a lot of services on this.

59:28.960 --> 59:29.460
Yeah.

59:29.460 --> 59:32.240
Don't know why I don't have it on, but it's the haven I've ever heard of that.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:34.240 --> 59:37.840
And we've probably had some of that kind of how or what.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.640
Yes, good idea.

59:38.640 --> 59:39.600
It was all that.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.760
How do you know you're in a vital relationship?

59:41.760 --> 59:42.260
Yeah.

59:42.400 --> 59:42.900
Yeah.

59:42.960 --> 59:46.960
And I know that that was a questionnaire, but they could become questions for that as well.

59:48.160 --> 59:48.660
Yeah.

59:48.720 --> 59:50.480
The more questions you give it the better.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:51.280 --> 59:51.780
Yeah.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.160
What about testimonials?

59:56.880 --> 59:59.040
I think that would be useful to try and get some...

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.960
I can follow up with them while I get...

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.460
Yeah.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:05.280
Now, what they'll give me is like, like you're talking about testimonials of a...

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.160
I'm talking about testimonials of like four or five lines and that's all you'll get now.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.660
Okay.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah, no, that's probably...

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.360
In the testimonial books...

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.840
You want the testimonials that gonna tell you...

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.240
What worked for them.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.240
You want a three or four page answer.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.360
What worked for you.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:25.860
Yeah.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.580
Yeah.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.760
So that then that's kind of knowledge then that can be extracted that, you know,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.480
these services were important in this situation, that kind of thing.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.320
So, yeah, if you kind of can get any of those sort of following up anyway...

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:44.820
Yes.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.400
Not, we'll just have to...

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.560
That's enough to see what's going back.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.060
Yeah.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:49.940
Okay.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.700
If you can take those questions that are on that,

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.180
what you would up there, the tangent there, all these questions.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.540
If you can get these off that, send them on to me as well.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.040
Right.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.020
I can ask a few of the victims, the survivors that we have.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:06.520
Yeah.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.180
A few of the questions in relation to that.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:08.680
Yeah.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.480
Yeah.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:09.980
Okay.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:10.720
Yeah.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.540
That could be.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.040
Yeah.

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.820
If you can remember them or you can just get them off that.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.320
Yeah.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.280
Okay.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:17.160
Yeah.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.100
I'll have to think about that.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.600
Yeah.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.320
That's it.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.720
Whatever you want from the thing and all it can do is go and ask them.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.220
Yeah.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.000
That's the main thing.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:35.080
And I think that the next step then is keep working on it and we'll play around with the

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.360
models themselves and the output they produce and at some point we might go to you or get

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.840
the information again and just kind of show you some different options that we've come

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.760
up with for responses and just see which ones make sense and which ones don't.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.260
Yeah.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.480
I'll bring one of my colleagues with me today.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.080
I tried to bring her today.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.400
She couldn't have got a new worker and her previous worker today was, she was just the

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.400
best she finds a poor person for too long.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.120
Oh right.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:00.620
So.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.260
Yeah.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.760
She would have been very useful to have.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.260
Yeah.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.760
So I will bring her with me the next time.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.260
Yeah.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.760
Okay.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.260
Yeah.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:06.760
Yeah.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.260
Brilliant.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.260
That sounds good.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:08.760
Yeah.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.260
Yeah.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:09.760
It's okay?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.260
Sounds good.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.760
Yeah.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.260
Nice to meet you.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:11.760
Thanks a million.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.260
Adrian.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:12.760
Be in touch?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.260
Yeah.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:13.760
Okay.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.260
See you later.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:14.760
See you guys.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.260
Bye.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:15.760
Have a nice day.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.820
Bye.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.820
Now I don't know.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.320
Yeah.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320
What we need to looks like.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.820
Yeah.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.320
Yeah.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:53.820
Yeah.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.320
Maybe it's useful.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.820
Maybe it's not so useful.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.320
Yeah.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.820
Yeah.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.320
But we will see.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:57.820
Yeah.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.320
Yeah.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:58.820
I think.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.320
Yeah.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:02:59.820
Definitely.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:07.320
I think we need to test that and maybe that's about having, having another version that

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.320
has a repository of testimonials included and version that doesn't.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320
Oh yeah.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320
Yes.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.820
Yes.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.320
That makes any difference.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.320
Now I think the, the data part, we, we get this back.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320
I need to look into it.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320
Yeah.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.320
I think there's some insight there.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.320
We'll, we'll have a look at that data from the app again and see if that's something

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.320
that we can use and it might give us information on websites that then you could add to your

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.320
scraping tool.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:56.320
Um, and I think then we could look at structuring those responses and the, the main things.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:06.320
So somebody asks a question, say, um, you know, can I get support or what support I

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320
can get?

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:15.320
And then we probably need a breakdown of what the support is, why the support is relevant,

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.320
what they can get out of it, what the outcomes are, um, rather than just their query.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.320
I think we can augment it to, to try and include those data in the response as well.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320
Yes.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:37.320
And also now the chatbot, the end of chatbot, it will not ask, try, it will not try to ask,

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:44.320
like try to narrow down your, the, the, like if you are a man or woman.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320
Yeah.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Yeah.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.320
So the chatbot should narrow down.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:57.320
But, but, but how deep should the chatbot ask?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.320
Like I ask you if a man or woman.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:06.320
And next question, do I need to ask your age range?

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:15.320
Like if a young male or old man, then you can ask more detailed question.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.320
So how deep should the chatbot ask?

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:29.320
I think the only, the only significant difference there is whether they're a child or an adult.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
Okay.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320
I don't think age would matter beyond that.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320
Okay.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320
Okay.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320
That's, that's easier.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320
Yeah.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320
You don't have to.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
Yeah.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320
Okay.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:48.320
Like on those websites that you're scraping, um, maybe it's worth trying to pick out tokens

01:05:48.320 --> 01:06:00.320
for, you know, gender or children versus adults and to try and use that to categorize or classify

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.320
some of the information and who it's relevant for.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.320
And those could give you things then that might be follow-up prompts or things that

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.320
you can emphasize in the responses that, um, you know, if there's stuff that's just for

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:20.320
children, if there's stuff that, um, is for men specifically, then those could be things

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.320
that you could, yeah, bring out more in the responses.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320
Okay.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.320
Okay.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:36.320
Then, um, do you mean like before I put these things into the knowledge base, I do these

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320
things before?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
Yeah.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320
Maybe.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Like children or adults.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
Yeah.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.320
But that's, okay.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:57.320
And then, okay, I will, um, try to find if some other project use this, this thing, because

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:04.320
from my understanding, like the ritual part, they should already do this.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:17.320
Like if you said, I'm a, I'm a children, I'm a child, and this, uh, the embedding will,

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:26.320
will already trust from this sentence into like some number.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:36.320
So the, the ritual part, we already try to find all the children part inside of the knowledge

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320
base.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
Yeah.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:51.320
So I don't need to do the classification because it will, for the retrieval, it's, it's already

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:59.320
to the classification because the embedded of children and out is definitely different.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320
Yeah.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:07.320
I suppose what might be useful is if the retrieval part, cause if you ask a general question,

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:13.320
then you'll get lots of stuff returned in the retrieval part.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.320
But if there's particular embeddings with what's returned, it seemed to be relevant

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.320
to those are things that probably should be accounted for in the response.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.320
Even if that's to kind of say that some of this information is to do with children, some

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.320
of it is to do with adults.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.320
Would you like to kind of, you know, enter it down or something like that.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:43.320
So if there's embeddings and stuff that seemed prominent or relevant and they, those could

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320
be the subject to follow up questions or.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.320
Yeah.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.320
That's, that's what I need to do.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.320
The follow up questions part.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:09:03.320
Now I notice these recent models, they will always ask follow up questions.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:11.320
But previously, let's say one years before, they don't ask these follow up questions.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.320
Right.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.320
So I think they, they, they also notice what you mentioned.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:24.320
Like if they can narrow down the, the, the, the question, they can give better answers.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320
Yeah.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320
Yeah.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320
Yeah.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320
Generally I think that was useful.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320
Did you find it useful?

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320
Yeah.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320
Yeah.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Okay.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320
Great.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320
I need to incorporate in this.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.320
Yeah.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320
Yeah.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:47.320
Do you want to make some notes on the meeting after you've kind of listened to it back and

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.320
stuff and just put them on the.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320
Email or Notion?

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320
Notion.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320
Yeah.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320
Okay.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.320
Put them up there just cause it, it'd be useful just to kind of see those written down.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.320
Yeah.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.320
I think it's useful for my, the, the paper report.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320
Yeah.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320
Yeah.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Actually, I feel regret previously, we have so many meetings.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.320
I, I didn't do some enough notes.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320
Oh, right.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Okay.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Yeah.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320
Well, that was a good time to start.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320
I hope it's not too late.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Yeah.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320
Right.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320
Yeah.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320
We'll leave it there cause I have to go.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320
Okay.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:48.320
And we have a meeting in, so yeah, we need to put in a recurring meeting.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:55.320
Um, when would be useful for you to meet again?

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:02.320
Um, this week I'll be around on Wednesday, but otherwise it would be online.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.320
So maybe if we go to next week.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320
But, but, but what's the point?

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320
We meet like two days later.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320
Yeah.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320
That's another point as well.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320
I need to, yeah.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
Yeah.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.320
I got some time to consume all these.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.320
Should we go with next Thursday?

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320
Yeah.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320
Next Thursday I think.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.320
I have one, almost two weeks.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320
Yeah.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.320
So if I put a meeting in for 1.30.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320
Okay.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320
Okay.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.320
I'll make that a recurring meeting as well.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.320
So we don't just run into the same issue again.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320
Oh, okay.
