0	5000	I've been thinking of this about, first of all, the people that don't come forward, what kind of information they'd like to know.
5000	14000	Yeah, so that person that you're thinking of, you know, downloads this app or kind of gets it on their phone somehow,
14000	18000	what would the kind of question or how do you think they'd find out?
18000	22000	Well, the first question that they would be asking is, what's out there, first of all?
22000	28000	What's available for me if I was to leave home right now? Where can I go? Is there any place I can go?
28000	33000	Then the second question would be, do the guards have to be notified if I go to that refuge?
33000	37000	Do tusla need to be, you know, if I go to that refuge?
37000	42000	These are all the kind of things that are going on and that's an awful lot that prevents people from coming forward.
42000	51000	So then, behind it, that's what they think of the children. What's available for the children out there if I don't want to come forward?
51000	54000	Do the schools have to be notified?
54000	60000	All these things kind of keep coming, rambling around in their heads and that's what prevents them coming forward.
60000	65000	If they had access to the information, as you say, not going through all these websites,
65000	69000	you could put in what's available to me and something comes up into prayer, something comes up in Dublin.
69000	72000	They're no good to anyone. They're no good to anyone.
72000	77000	So having something like this is great but the kind of questions that they might be asking is,
78000	82000	if I'm thinking now from a man's point of view, what's available?
82000	86000	It's a lot of what's available to me. That's a lot of the stuff.
86000	90000	What's available to me, how, what, when, where, why?
90000	96000	So how do I go about getting support? Do I need support? Why do I need this support?
96000	101000	What's available for me? What's available for him? What's available for the kids?
101000	104000	It's all about the what is before they go forward.
104000	108000	So what, how do I, how do I…
108000	110000	How do I access support?
110000	112000	How do I access support? Would that be…
112000	114000	That would be how do I access support?
114000	115000	Okay.
115000	117000	And I'm living in wherever.
117000	118000	Okay.
118000	120000	What supports are available to me in?
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	124000	Now I don't know how specific you can get in relation to that.
124000	132000	Yeah, well that's the task is to try and refine it as much as possible so that we do get accurate information.
132000	135000	So how do I access support? What supports are out there?
135000	136000	Yeah.
136000	142000	For me, my husband, who's a perpetrator of domestic violence, and then the children.
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	144000	That's a huge one.
144000	145000	Yeah.
145000	149000	And then basically what other services need to be involved?
149000	150000	Yeah.
150000	152000	So do they call the cards? Do all that kind of stuff?
152000	153000	Yeah.
153000	157000	That's the kind of, that's what I'd know for that information to be about that.
158000	165000	When you go in deep within, when you're talking about housing, social welfare, the finance side of things.
165000	166000	Yeah.
166000	173000	Like, what do I get on social welfare? I'm a single mother living with three children now.
173000	177000	He was a sole earner. As a result, I've no income.
177000	178000	Yeah.
178000	180000	If I leave him, what income would I have?
180000	181000	Yeah.
181000	185000	So that could be links to say social welfare all over the areas. There would be a tie to certain things.
185000	186000	Yeah.
186000	191000	They're also entitled to emergency deposits for apartments as well now, which is a great thing.
191000	192000	Okay.
192000	193000	Yeah. Which is huge.
193000	194000	Yeah.
194000	205000	Yeah. And so if you think of it for her, and I'm thinking of the father that came in with the four kids in the car, knowing that there was no place for him, but was there any place for his kids?
205000	208000	So are you talking about foster care or what are you talking about?
208000	209000	Yeah.
209000	214000	And he goes, I don't have any information. What's foster care? Can I still be involved? Can I go to foster care?
214000	215000	Yeah.
215000	221000	He did all this kind of stuff, but it was more about needed help with housing and he needed help with finance.
221000	225000	So questions would be there. How do I go about applying for social housing?
225000	227000	Okay. Yeah.
227000	231000	That's the kind of, the more you get out of this, it'll be the how, the what, the when, the why.
231000	244000	So if we start with how do I access support, say in Galway City, what kind of responses would you expect?
244000	253000	Are you giving your gender in that? Are you just being very specific, just what's available?
253000	264000	So one thing that we can do is think of it as a conversation between the app and the person.
264000	272000	And so if there's certain questions to ask the person in generating a response, then that's something that we can take into account as well.
272000	273000	Yeah.
273000	278000	So if I was sitting in front of you saying I'm in domestic violence, what can you do for me?
278000	284000	So the very first thing we'll be talking about is, is it just harm or is it children?
284000	285000	Yeah.
285000	291000	Then we're talking about, are you willing to leave today? If you're willing to leave, we can take you from here and bring you to a place of safety.
291000	294000	Safety would need to be mentioned in this a lot.
294000	295000	Right.
295000	298000	Safety, the word safety, because that's what we're trying to push out there.
298000	299000	Okay.
299000	307000	So then what happens, it'll be kind of, so they're moved out, they're brought to Mowela, beside Galway, you'd want that to be mentioned.
307000	313000	Then when they're assigned what services are available to the children there and what services are available in the community.
313000	314000	Okay.
314000	318000	So there'll be a lot of stuff around that for the children.
318000	319000	Okay.
320000	327000	Then you go back to, if you remember the LGBTQI+, it keeps changing.
327000	332000	Is it LGBTQI+, or is it LGBTQ?
332000	334000	It keeps changing.
334000	335000	Yeah.
335000	336000	Yeah.
336000	343000	But the members of the LGBT, what kind of supports are available for them? So you have a shout and you have a mock.
343000	345000	That's what they'd want to get from this.
345000	353000	So they're specifically designed to support people that are going through domestic violence within that cohort of people as well.
353000	354000	Yeah.
356000	357000	I'm rambling here, am I?
357000	363000	No, no, no. I'm just trying to think of it as kind of an interaction in the app.
364000	373000	If somebody just types in the question, how do I access support in Galway City?
373000	381000	Is there any point in giving them some answer to that at that point, or do you need follow-up questions?
381000	385000	You need follow-up questions because you don't know what kind of support they're looking for.
385000	388000	Yeah, so you'd need them to tell you their gender.
388000	389000	Yeah.
390000	394000	Well, it would be nice because, like, Moella don't take males.
394000	395000	Yeah.
395000	397000	So they would need to know their gender.
397000	398000	Yeah.
398000	400000	But that wouldn't be straight away.
400000	404000	Well, it would have to be, because if you're a man, you're looking up to see a refuge center.
404000	405000	Yeah, yeah.
405000	407000	He might show up to...
407000	415000	The other thing you often see with things like ChatGPT is that it'll give you a response,
415000	421000	and then it will say, if you'd like more specific information, tell them your gender or something like that.
421000	422000	Oh, okay.
422000	423000	So it can kind of give a...
423000	424000	That'll probably make more sense, yeah.
424000	427000	...a bit of a response and then say, you know, yeah.
427000	428000	Yeah.
428000	429000	What they also...
429000	432000	What supports are available to the guards and the courts?
432000	436000	So you're talking here about baron orders, protected orders, safety orders.
436000	437000	Hmm.
437000	438000	Yeah.
438000	439000	They would need to be built in as well.
439000	443000	So what kind of protective measures are out there for me if I come forward?
443000	444000	Yeah.
444000	445000	That kind of way.
445000	446000	Yeah.
446000	447000	If that makes sense.
447000	450000	So I suppose you just need to split them up into different categories, like...
450000	451000	Yeah.
451000	452000	...you know, kind of...
452000	454000	Like what we're doing with the act kind of way.
454000	455000	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
455000	456000	Yeah.
456000	457000	Yeah.
457000	458000	Yeah.
458000	462000	Well, we start with that support one and see what we get back, and then maybe we can
462000	467000	add some detail on gender and children and see...
467000	469000	Do you have some kind of way to set up here?
469000	470000	Can you just talk back to me, can I?
470000	471000	Yeah, yeah.
471000	472000	I can, yeah.
472000	473000	Not sure.
473000	476000	Can you just kind of type or tell us what to type?
476000	479000	Just say, what supports are available to me?
479000	480000	No, hang on.
480000	481000	That...
481000	482000	Hang on, hang on, hang on.
482000	483000	Hang on, hang on.
483000	484000	Hang on, hang on.
484000	486000	Is it very short questions we ask?
486000	487000	Or is it free?
487000	488000	Yeah, it'd be...
488000	489000	Well, it's...
489000	491000	It can be long-winded if they need to be.
491000	494000	Well, I'd just say, I'm a survivor of domestic violence.
494000	496000	What supports are available to me?
496000	497000	Right.
497000	498000	Is it?
498000	499000	Yeah.
499000	503000	Do you wanna...
503000	509000	Don't give it my type of day.
509000	515000	I am a survivor...
515000	516000	Of...
516000	518000	No, what did I say now?
518000	523000	No, I think we can also like...
523000	528000	No, survivor, no.
528000	557040	Let's see what goes back, maybe nothing In reality you'll probably get some people
557080	559080	I'm getting a laugh actually
561560	567600	But if I'm looking at that now gosh, that's bullshit in relation to can I scroll up there again, yeah
569400	571400	It's still generating
572360	577240	This one here on the right hand side is the kind of normal chat GPT
577240	583640	Yeah, and the other one is the one that uses the stuff okay from the website. It's just the idea of
583640	591360	Well, this is also from from everywhere USA UK yeah, I'll see
591360	596000	Do you want to put it in Ireland? Sorry? I should have put that in the question. Should I know this is the one
597800	599800	This is like for
600760	604680	This will not show to the user, but now for for test, okay
605360	607960	So what came up there then for Ireland sir?
608880	610880	I'm sorry the one you're building
611120	613600	Sir what supports came up?
625680	631240	I think it didn't give anything. Okay. The question was a little bit
633840	636480	Should be more like what refuges are available in glory
636480	638480	I
639280	641480	Should be about like what refuges are available
642920	644920	Possibly yeah, yeah
645600	649280	Is that what you if somebody asked for what supports are available?
649280	655000	Would you expect the refuges to come up like yeah, whatever? Yeah, you would you okay? Yeah
657080	665000	It will need know your location right yeah, so okay, so like if the question is like this
666480	671720	At least I need you I need to the chat bot should ask the user's location
672360	678560	Okay before it give the answer. Is that correct? Yeah, I guess if it's enough it might be yeah
679360	681360	location
681920	684560	GPS but yeah, I mean for this example, maybe
686800	693400	We should provide it explicitly in the in the question, let's say what refuges are available in goldway
694400	699520	How big are you making this is this stick for nationwide or sir and I
700600	702600	Could be yeah
703840	708100	Suppose it depends on access to it to relevant information
714760	719080	That supports are available to me and go away maybe what refuges
723400	725400	I
725400	727400	Say it's the running to me
728640	734120	Is it okay, so don't just worry when you get it funny. Yeah, that's it. Okay
745040	751480	Okay, she's looking up there no boy that's not there's a domestic violence response
753400	755400	But
760080	762780	This it says there are 20
763840	769340	It's still key didn't give you the space like to lose the gingerbread. Oh, yeah
772920	776720	Yeah, shouldn't give the name of the areas push
779520	781520	Is this a little bit around sir
782520	785080	Yeah, but that would definitely be one as well depends on
786640	792800	Their nature of their domestic violence relationship, but that actually would be there that would be in it as well. Sorry
801760	807960	So these are the answer I should get in this robot this chatbot
807960	815680	Where is Chuck Darragh from the refuge corporation record this chapter?
817440	819440	So the woman's refuge I
819920	823320	Said that this one doesn't tell us where the information was sourced from
823320	827080	I guess the other one does because we've provided the information
828200	830080	Women's Refuge
830080	832080	Corporation Road
837960	839960	I
854720	857360	So this is the one if the
858600	860600	like
860720	865340	The best model like like if I didn't give it any information
865900	871460	Okay, this is all from their like original training data
872100	876740	Okay. Yeah, so I want to improve their performance
877260	881340	Okay, give the better more in detail information
883620	885620	But here since
885660	889740	It's just a prototype. Yes. Okay. I think it's
890980	892980	Worse than this. Yes. Yes
895340	897340	You
899540	902540	Here I think cobra Louis
902540	925700	So what's coming up here is better than what we have over here. But the main one is not
925700	931740	there. Moetta is the first main point of contact that you would need if you're a female.
931740	936860	You're looking for support. Wanting to leave the house with the children. It's the one
936860	943380	thing that they always go for. And obviously there could be questions about Moetta as well.
943380	951380	So where I can get the information? Moetta. You Google Moetta. That's how much you're looking
951380	963060	for. Yeah, yeah. All the information that you require. Moetta. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e. Mo-e-h-e-i-l-e.
963060	990780	Two words you said here. Cope. It's under cope. That's the main one for women. And then
990780	995620	that takes the role of the children because they take the women and the children into
995620	1000100	the refuge. There's their own apartment on the side of the refuge, which is great. It's
1000100	1006500	not communal spaces anymore. It's like an apartment block. So that is the most ideal
1006500	1012500	one for the women. For the men, if you're asking what supports are available for men,
1012500	1018420	they're very limited as we know. You'd be talking about Men's Network. But they're based
1018420	1025860	in Waterford. But they cover the whole country through counselling. And they also offer legal
1025860	1034060	support if needed, which is great. So if you're a father, you are going to be looking for
1034060	1038060	the same things, like what's available for me out there. When I'm in domestic violence
1038060	1042860	for five years, I've had enough. Can I get her out? How do I get her out of the house?
1042860	1047940	So you're talking here about what are the orders? The courts. If you want to do that,
1047940	1053700	just separate. As I said, supports, then maybe look at the finance. Housing is going to be
1053700	1059740	huge. It's going to be huge anywhere. Massive. So I'd be kind of like stuff around having
1059740	1066020	the same community there with a helpline, counter-council, having the, you know. Would
1066020	1070180	this give websites, if you ask for it, could I get the website for a call with counter-council?
1070180	1076820	Yeah. And then you get the social housing form. And then you have the, whatever kind
1076820	1084100	of support the council can offer. Can I apply for a deposit for under the domestic violence
1084100	1088940	provision? Yes, you can. How will they go about doing that? So you've got one section
1088940	1094260	just on finance to include all that. So if Anto comes up on finance, on the question,
1094260	1100780	it'll bring it straight to that section that should be developed in your letter. Yeah.
1100780	1109660	Is, are the kind of answers to those questions, um, published in different places? Not really.
1109660	1117780	Not really. No, not really. They say it's here, but here's the, here's the social, sorry,
1117780	1122660	just the form of social housing, but yet you have to go to revenue. Yeah. And then you
1122660	1126180	have to go and you have to get an affidavit signed and people get overwhelmed by that
1126180	1131300	then. So it's about having the support that will help them go through that is what's needed.
1131300	1136380	Unless they're well able to go themselves. But for the very start, when people are contacted
1136380	1143420	and are using this, it is crisis management. Where can I go right now? It's quarter past
1143420	1148140	one on a Friday. I need to get the hell out of here before he comes home. Where do I go?
1148140	1153380	What's this? Oh, Pops Moella. They contact Moella. Are you safe or do we need to contact
1153380	1158660	the guards to bring you here? Yeah. That's the question that will come back to me. But
1158660	1167180	what you just want for the, for this is to give them information on Moella. Yeah. What's
1167180	1191660	this query? I just asked. I'm a man. Where can I go?
1191660	1201820	So before this, I want to know like these, like basic answers. Are they accurate? Yes.
1201820	1207100	That's correct. Go around crisis. Okay. I haven't heard of transgender quality network
1207100	1215460	Ireland. So it says a service to people in Galway, but they must exist somewhere. But
1215460	1226500	there's a lot of stuff that's stable. It's fairly. No, none of that. None of that. All
1226500	1233220	that. No. Okay. So you would take a one. Yes. 100%. Call your rape crisis. Definitely would
1233220	1240420	be involved in that. Okay. Yeah. They would be kind of providing counseling at a later
1240420	1251140	stage more so than after family leave. That's the direction. So one, I think one problems
1251140	1257780	may, maybe the, the, the, the base model is sometimes they, they, they cannot give you
1257780	1264060	the accurate information. And I think in this situation, the, the accuracy is important.
1264060	1275860	So yeah, but, so I thought maybe, no, I mean, in my chatbot, sometimes the, they cannot
1275860	1284980	find the information, but at least I need to make sure the accuracy of the information.
1284980	1304500	And wait a sec. Where's the, where's my, where's my, the, the question I'm a man. Okay. Here.
1304500	1314060	So another thing is you mentioned the, like the, when, when people ask for support, like
1314060	1322740	the house finance, all this stuff, do, do you, do you mean then in this chatbot, it,
1322740	1329200	it doesn't need to give you this instructions. It only need to give you the information where
1329200	1345400	you can find the, where you need to go, where you need to go. Okay. Do you want to try one
1345400	1355000	of it? The children, something like I've got two children, what supports are available
1355000	1380200	for them? Where should I go? What can I get? What, what support can I, can they get? For
1410200	1417960	example, you know, it's going into, it's coming into stuff like, you know, 10 GP services.
1417960	1425080	That's kind of straightforward enough really. Um, free counseling services. Okay. I should
1425080	1440000	be looking at your one over here. Should I? Oh, okay. You'd expect rainbows to be coming
1440000	1444640	up there now. They're, they're a national organization as well, but that's their own
1444640	1449040	bereavement. But it's a bit, it's also about lots of parents, even though it doesn't have
1449040	1454800	to be bereaved or separated. They're going to be separated as a result of this. So that
1454800	1459040	would be one support that would come up. And it's a national organization. Should you just
1459040	1469400	put in rainbows? They're their rainbows, Ireland. So they're based all over the country. Okay.
1469400	1473720	It would be a good support for, now you have to be six months separated or six months before
1473720	1478640	you can go on and put their rain all over the place. But it is a good support for, for
1478640	1483440	children because it's specifically designed for, as I said, breach or separate parents.
1483440	1487760	Okay. The only difference is if you're in a group you're never put in with a group who's
1487760	1492760	separated if you're, with your parents bereaved. Okay. Obviously. So you're definitely getting
1492760	1497000	the one to one support and those groups are very small, doing it in around three. Okay.
1497000	1502560	It's going to be 54 or 55 kids in the evening, so only three in it. It's a great service
1502560	1506400	to have. It would be a service that parents would be looking for, but not for our parents
1506400	1514600	would know about it. Right. Okay. Yeah. So that would be one kind of aspect. Yeah. So
1514600	1521240	is there a rainbows program in Galway? I thought it was a voice recognition thing as well.
1521240	1534480	I haven't tried, I haven't tried. Oh, sorry. Is there, sorry. I get lazy. Is there a rainbows
1534480	1557800	program in Galway? What? Thank you. Good.
1587800	1601760	Where does it start again? There. The once more, yeah. See the rainbows Ireland program
1601760	1606280	for children who have experienced death and force or other fabric changes. Okay. That's
1606280	1611240	all there. Yeah. We're talking about complaints and Brussels and all that kind of stuff. To
1611240	1618400	you. So it would be the main one here. Definitely there. He just, he never heard of that service
1618400	1625520	club and clinic or that and it's going down into what you watch. We'd have both local
1625520	1633120	schools and communities and just go ahead and pay agency. I assume kind of shorter responses
1633120	1641120	or more of what people would be after to the point. If you think that if you're in a crisis
1641160	1647200	where the fuck can I go? Yeah. And like, you know, is he going to follow me? Yeah. How
1647200	1653480	do I get there? Yeah. Yeah. Should it be taxi numbers? Can I get a taxi? Can you book a
1653480	1658560	taxi from this? Yeah. Yeah. You know, if you get to my wallet, I'd actually pay for your
1658560	1662920	taxi if you didn't want to pay for the taxi. Okay. It's a great service. Like if you're
1662920	1670040	living out in that really like if you're over kind of is where that lady was from was Glinsk.
1670040	1674880	There's nothing, no taxes over there. So we had to bring her from Glinsk into Mowell
1674880	1682280	and Galway with six kids. That was a fun drive. Yeah. Cause kids wanted to be with Bellamy
1682280	1690920	and the car. Of course. So seven seater kids. Yeah. One extra overload. Overload. Yeah. Needs
1690920	1699920	most. Yeah. Needs most. Yeah, exactly. Squad car going ahead of us. Yeah. So some of these
1699920	1704480	things are good. Some of them are. It's really giving you a lot of information to find out
1704480	1708080	the rainbows for a lot of direct wind contact. Local, you're not going to be contacted. There's
1708080	1717240	no, I, in my knowledge base, there's no information about this website. So it didn't give anything.
1717240	1726160	Okay. All right. Is there any kind of testimonials, something like testimonials that would exist
1726160	1732320	where victims would describe the actual, you know, the fact that I went to Mowella because,
1732320	1737400	and they helped me with XYZ. As I said to you, I emailed to Mowella to give me a few
1737400	1744920	testimonials and they never got back to me. Okay. Yeah. So I think it's, it's that kind
1744920	1753240	of, I see the testimonials as a place where it puts all of the stuff, the reason why things
1753240	1761080	are done together and it kind of puts relevant stuff together. And that's all stuff that is
1761080	1767200	something that a model like this could pick up on and use. So kind of joining the dots rather
1767200	1773120	than just a directory of information, but you don't really know why you need that stuff. So I
1773120	1782480	think to make it more useful, something like those would be good. I mean, the only other thing I can
1782520	1788040	think of beyond that is like if we sat down and did an interview with you and transcribed the
1788040	1791680	whole thing where you're talking through these things, but that's something then that could
1791680	1801000	probably go out on a date and that sort of thing. But it's this, I think the thing that's hard to,
1801000	1811360	to get at is, you know, you would do this because, and this will help you with XYZ. And when you do
1811360	1817240	that, you might do this kind of connecting it to come up with a, you know, a plan or something
1817240	1822760	that's relevant for a particular, someone's particular situation. Well, it's, it's, it's,
1822760	1830160	it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a very basic enough, right? You would go to a refuge, which
1830160	1834760	your kids, and they try and locate you in a different area, get the court system behind you,
1834760	1839320	get a baron orders, that guy can go near them for five years. That's the kind of it. And they're
1839320	1844240	happy with that. And that's 100%. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. Because they only have a two year old
1844240	1848400	and don't be seven. You know, you have a 12 year old and there's an older 17. Yeah. So
1848400	1853760	self determinate all that kind of stuff themselves. But that's really what they want. That's where
1853760	1859240	can I go? Where am I safe? Where are the kids safe? Yeah. Like, I can't imagine you use this
1859240	1864720	when you're post after that. When you're say, when you're inside, are you going to go look
1864720	1869720	for this again? Housing is a great idea. But I'll go back to the chatbot again and see, can they
1869720	1874800	give me information on housing? Whereas citizens information, I'm not, not by any means. It's
1874800	1880800	great. I'm just trying to give the idea like a success story or this it's basic enough of what
1880800	1886120	the success will be. Yeah. It's very easy to say it. But the reality is I'm trying to find a house
1886120	1890000	for someone to move into. Yeah, it's very difficult. And then you talk about the schools,
1890640	1897360	changing our schools, how to change the schools, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So like,
1897360	1901560	whatever it is that you're trying to get from this, is it to give it to me as much information
1901560	1906600	as possible, then that will become overpowering to me. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know, so even like,
1906600	1913040	give me four or five of the top ones will be ideal. Yeah. So what we're trying to understand
1913040	1919400	is what would be useful to get out of it. And then how can we tweak it so that it does
1920200	1925680	produce that. So in a way, we're trying to get in the heads of somebody who would be using it. And,
1925680	1935760	you know, in some ways, it's probably about making sure that the answers to their questions
1935760	1941640	are accurate. But then there's probably other roles that could have like, like, if there's
1941640	1948000	stuff that they, you know, hadn't thought about asking, but would be useful for them to know,
1948000	1955560	at this point in their kind of situation, then the chatbot can provide information on those
1955560	1962720	things as well and give them a sense of what that journey ahead might look like to, I suppose,
1962720	1967280	illustrate that, you know, there's a way out of it. Yeah. That's what the testimonials were
1967280	1976880	probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. So, so I think what would you like to have from the
1976880	1988480	testimonials? What kind of, um, so rather than doing an interview now with people, what would be
1988480	2000240	I, uh, this is, this is all kind of based on what I think would be useful. It doesn't necessarily
2000240	2011600	mean it would be, but, um, from, from, from what I think the testimonials could describe someone's
2011600	2020040	situation that they found themselves in, um, and describe their journey or their path to getting
2020040	2028240	support, things that worked well, things that didn't. And if you had enough of those, um, then,
2028240	2036200	uh, and you were able to provide them to something like this, then it would be able to pick the bits
2036200	2040640	that are relevant from different ones to find the ones that are relevant to a particular person's
2040640	2049920	situation and to use those to generate a response. So it's a man with children who, um, is in some
2049920	2055040	particular situation and there might be, if you had like a few different testimonials that kind of
2055040	2060880	match that, um, then there might be some say in the right location. And so you might be able to
2060880	2068320	kind of pick bits from them to kind of kind of frame your answer based on that frame, you know,
2068320	2078480	someone's experiences rather than, um, cause I think it's in that way, it's, it would allow you
2078480	2087920	to provide responses that, um, don't just present a particular service in isolation, but it's more
2087920	2093840	presenting it that in a way that, you know, you might need this, this and this because somebody
2093840	2098320	else did and found those useful and they were in a similar situation to you, which you wouldn't get
2098320	2103440	from any of those individual websites, but you get it because this person experienced that and that
2103440	2111280	worked for them. So it's the testimonials for me provide a way of linking different services, um,
2111280	2118160	to provide a useful journey for somebody out of that situation. Okay. I should have written down
2118160	2129360	that. You can give me a transcript of that. I actually could get you a few testimonials from
2129360	2134800	our case that are open to us at the moment. They're coming towards the end of it. Right. But
2134800	2142080	if you could type up those questions that you just said there, I can run that by them. Yeah.
2142080	2146320	Yeah. Definitely get four testimonials. Anyway, like one will talk for Ireland, like, you know,
2147200	2152000	yeah. Or she's good. If that's what you want, that's what's needed. What do you think would be
2152000	2161520	useful? Uh, the thing you said, the testimonial part, does that mean, uh, I need to, the chatbot
2161520	2168640	need to ask the user a lot of information. Possibly, yeah. But will the user willing to
2168640	2175760	type so many things? It's like almost like type, uh, all the
2178240	2185200	story. Well, I'm thinking that you might get at something like the, um, chatbot might say,
2186080	2194240	um, yes, we have various different organizations that offer support. Some of these are specific to
2194240	2200000	men. Some are specific to, to women. Um, if you'd like more detail on any of these,
2200000	2204640	let me know if you're a man or a woman, I might just type man. And then I might go into more
2204640	2214800	detail on this. And all of that is forming an interaction then that, um, the, obviously the
2214800	2220240	way that these work is that pre the previous conversation is taken into account in any
2220240	2225920	responses. So they've already declared they're a man and other answers could take that into
2225920	2231920	account as well. So you need to keep restating the situation, but it's more like with a support
2231920	2237920	worker, they would develop an understanding over time and only, uh, present stuff that's relevant.
2240960	2246400	If you were to get testimonials like that, and that was your main source of data, you'd probably
2246400	2252320	need a lot of them, wouldn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably the limiting factor here is that,
2252800	2257600	um, unless there there's a good source and it's readily available,
2259200	2263920	it's probably unrealistic to ask you to produce the event you would need to come up with any kind
2263920	2273920	of good answers to it. So, um, in that case, we'd, we'd need to try and I suppose just make best use
2273920	2287440	of the stuff that is available. Um, yeah. Um, yeah. So, um, the information part is definitely
2287440	2297440	need to improve the, you said the testimony part, uh, if they're just like, not, I don't,
2297440	2306400	I don't get so many data should I still use this? Well, one thing we could think about doing is to
2307600	2317280	kind of think about it as a, as a kind of a feasibility or, um, uh, of the tool for maybe
2317280	2324320	one particular user group. So we could try and get like, I don't know, 10 testimonials or something
2324320	2333280	that are all from people in a similar area or maybe similar gender, and then just, um,
2333280	2339440	kind of test whether or not if we were playing the part of somebody in a similar role,
2339440	2345680	would we get better responses if we had those testimonials available? Um, and that would just
2345680	2351120	allow us to kind of, yeah, test whether that testimonial approach would be something that was
2351120	2355760	worth pursuing if we did have resources to do that or whether, you know, the responses
2355760	2363600	actually aren't much better if you do have that data. Um, that could be one, one, um, way to go.
2370000	2374560	The localization of things is, is another important aspects. Yeah.
2374880	2381760	So that's something to think about. How, how do you do that?
2382560	2386240	Is that something that can be picked up in the scraping or is it something that
2386240	2389520	would need someone to manually tie things that
2393600	2399360	if I ask us about an action rather than just what's available. So how do I get support?
2399360	2410480	Hmm. The other thing with a testimonial as well is it would probably include things like multiple
2410480	2417040	factors like housing, finance, children, that sort of thing that the chatbot could use to
2417040	2423600	structure answers and say, um, here's areas that people commonly need to consider. Is there any
2423600	2430480	of these that you would, um, you know, well, that's all good. It's all the finance stuff
2430480	2436640	there and all that. Don't know how much we're just getting it all from, but just go up again.
2436640	2440720	I think the format is broken or something. Where's my question?
2442960	2447600	How do I get support? So it's telling me there about immediate safety. It's the contact
2447600	2453600	guardians, other ones, domestic violence service, seek refuge in shelter. That's all there.
2454880	2459120	Haven though, if you're homeless or need emergency, the Haven can provide shelter.
2461040	2464240	The Haven. Never heard that in Galway is it? Yeah.
2467840	2475120	It's Haven Galway. H-A-V-E-N. I'm going to address here Boundary Avenue.
2475840	2480080	It's an apartment that you can rent at booking.com.
2485120	2491120	It's a apartment? One Boundary Avenue.
2491120	2505760	Meals are in Project Burger, Car of Haven, Family Hope.
2511920	2513120	Chop Car of Day Center.
2513120	2525760	There's Car of Haven, Family Hope, and that's what it's referred to.
2528080	2530240	But again, that's not much use to you if... No.
2531840	2538720	This is going to react to all the legal advice. That's actually not bad. If you ask actions
2539360	2545840	rather than give me, you get more of a... So what was your restaurant there?
2545840	2549680	I just asked, how do I get support? How? How? Okay.
2554000	2556160	Rather than what's available, you're going to get everything.
2559840	2565200	There's a few sites that we've come across. How do I go to refuge?
2565200	2570640	Pretty straightforward. I don't see why they'll give me that.
2578640	2580720	They'll tell you why you would go to a refuge.
2582320	2586160	That's actually a good question as well. Why would I go to a refuge?
2586160	2591040	I'm just going to put it out to the loo for a second.
2593280	2593680	Sorry.
2599040	2602000	There's a lot of information which is generated for that one.
2602960	2605040	I'm not destroying it now.
2614240	2617920	Is this perhaps a PhD for you, or is it a master's or...
2617920	2620960	Master. In artificial intelligence, is it?
2621520	2622160	In what?
2622160	2622960	Artific... AI?
2623520	2629200	No, it's data analytics. It's very similar to AI. We have a lot of same class.
2629200	2629600	Okay.
2629600	2630100	Yeah.
2633520	2635440	This is law school overnight now.
2635440	2636400	It's never stopped.
2638400	2639280	Can I stop it?
2640000	2644400	Yeah. Is something wrong happened?
2647760	2649280	Right. It's some...
2651760	2656080	There are not some meaningful words?
2656080	2656320	No.
2656320	2657200	No meaningful?
2657200	2657920	No.
2657920	2659680	Okay. Something is wrong here.
2661760	2662320	Oh, come on.
2669440	2671280	I think something is wrong here.
2676560	2680880	I think it's in your loop, the software.
2680880	2690160	I cannot hear.
2690160	2694960	Okay. The website is in freeze, I think.
2700960	2705280	Okay. I killed the website, totally.
2710880	2714160	Okay. This is the...
2717280	2718800	You okay for talking to me, man?
2718800	2719360	Yeah, I'm okay.
2729360	2733920	The best model, there's something wrong in the best model.
2734880	2740400	It's... Continue to give all the nonsense words.
2741120	2742480	All right. Okay. Yeah.
2744720	2746880	I don't know what's wrong here. See?
2747680	2748320	Right. Okay.
2748320	2751520	It's even freeze the web page.
2752320	2755760	Okay. What's the question you asked?
2755760	2756880	What was the question?
2756880	2767680	How do I go to a refuge here?
2767680	2768560	Maybe a typo?
2769120	2773120	No, but here my rag for this is good.
2773120	2779040	Okay. In terms of the...
2780720	2785280	You mentioned those things that you would want to know for each thing.
2785760	2788880	It was the... How? What?
2789840	2792320	The with the why. That's the best of the first in those questions.
2793360	2793680	Right.
2793680	2795200	Something very short and snappy.
2795200	2796720	How do I go to a refuge?
2796720	2798960	What's available to me in a refuge?
2798960	2800560	Where do I get counselling?
2802000	2803760	Tell them that's it. Where would I get counselling?
2806720	2808640	So you get everything here now again.
2808640	2809680	How do you spell counselling?
2809680	2810480	C-O-U-N.
2810480	2813600	C-O-U-N.
2823360	2830400	Because we can ask the model to provide answers in particular formats as well.
2830400	2839040	So if the why or whatever was always important, then you could incorporate that into the responses.
2839040	2845200	And maybe that's something that is worth doing because everything you suggest,
2847840	2850560	somebody would probably want an explanation to...
2852400	2855120	Why would they do that in the first place and what would they get out of it?
2857040	2863760	So knowing what they would want from those responses will help us structure things better.
2869040	2873200	Where do I get counselling?
2879040	2883440	Okay, this is the first time the body is quicker than this one.
2884880	2890000	Oh no, I think it's the incident situation again.
2890960	2891760	It won't stop.
2895120	2896720	I think there's some bug there.
2899040	2902720	It won't stop.
2904480	2911440	And then the page freeze.
2921120	2923920	So what's your in-project look like here?
2924800	2938240	So, if we get this to a state where it's providing sufficient answers,
2940160	2944160	your end product could take different forms.
2944160	2947520	It could be something on a website, it could be something in a mobile app.
2948400	2956640	So the end product, as I imagine it is, it's a mobile app that you can use in discrete mode.
2956640	2960880	And it's just a simple interface like this.
2960880	2966160	You ask questions, but it provides all of the information that you would get from
2968160	2973200	the kind of app that we were looking at before, but it provides it in a way that
2973440	2978800	makes the information easier to access.
2978800	2983760	But also, one thing that we talked about is that depending on the situation of the person,
2983760	2990480	you could customize the way what information is presented and what's not.
2992160	2996560	The bot can do that as well.
2996560	2999280	It can customize things to people's situations.
3000160	3008160	Rather than being kind of clunky that it just reorders boxes to show you what information.
3008160	3014160	I see that as stuff that keeps popping up here in relation to physical abuse.
3015040	3016880	It's more about just coercive control.
3016880	3018960	That's the main thing about domestic violence.
3018960	3021520	How do I know that I'm in a coercive control relationship?
3021520	3034640	No, I mean, I feel it's something wrong in my program.
3034640	3036400	Oh, I forgot again.
3038480	3039840	No, they're okay.
3040880	3044000	No, it can never stop now.
3044000	3045600	It's like in a loop or something.
3047520	3050320	They actually gave good information at the start of that.
3050320	3051200	Yeah, yes.
3051200	3053040	They did actually give good information.
3054880	3056400	I don't know that lady.
3056400	3057840	She rang and it was me.
3057840	3058720	She was contacted.
3059360	3060240	She rang me.
3060240	3063840	It was quarter past four on a Tuesday evening.
3063840	3064400	She rang me.
3065040	3066160	She said she'd been looking up.
3067760	3070400	She said she could all have kept coming up with Tuesday.
3070400	3071760	So she wouldn't give her name.
3071760	3073440	She wouldn't give her kids names or nothing.
3073440	3077120	She wouldn't know what is available for her right now.
3077120	3079120	He's not home till 8 o'clock this evening.
3079120	3079760	He's at work.
3080640	3081760	She says, I'm sitting here.
3081760	3084480	My two guys are bleeding and he's after hitting one of the children.
3084480	3085600	I don't want to stand by that.
3086160	3087680	I need to get out of here.
3087680	3089280	Do I call the guards or who do I call?
3089920	3091760	I said, well, are you safe when he comes home?
3091760	3092960	So I know she says I'm petrified.
3093760	3094960	I said, have you anywhere to go?
3094960	3095680	She said, no.
3095680	3097280	Do you want me to create a place for you to go?
3098000	3099120	And then I told her about Moila.
3099120	3099760	What's Moila?
3099760	3101520	I said, well, look, we've got four hours.
3101520	3104320	Do you want to have a look at Moila on the website yourself and see what you think?
3105040	3107040	She still wouldn't give me her name or address or anything.
3107040	3107760	So she went off.
3107760	3108960	She looked at Moila.
3109360	3112160	I told her, I'm going to stay on the phone because I wouldn't let her go.
3112160	3114960	So she got back and she goes, that's where I need to go.
3115520	3116480	Can you make that happen?
3117360	3121040	I said, I can't, but give me a minute to make sure there's a bed available for you.
3121040	3121520	Yeah.
3121520	3123040	And there were random, there was.
3123680	3127360	And then basically they said, we're going to contact the guards.
3127360	3129840	I said, well, I don't even see no dates.
3129840	3132080	She doesn't want to give me anything because she hears I'm too slow.
3132640	3134960	But yeah, she's going to, she arranged, she arranged.
3134960	3138640	She met me at the local center shop over in Winhamstown.
3139360	3140800	A very small little dinky shop.
3140800	3146880	And there she was herself, just the children and their suitcases at the side of the road
3146880	3150880	waiting to know if I got a puncture or God forbid anything happened, you know,
3151520	3155760	but pick them up, brought them in and still wouldn't give me her name.
3155760	3157440	But she wasn't from Glynamada.
3157440	3158880	She got texted to Glynamada.
3159600	3160320	She was from Glyn.
3161520	3162720	I found out afterwards.
3162720	3167200	So yeah, so now she's, she's open to our service and she will answer any of those.
3167200	3169120	But she said, I just needed to get out.
3169920	3170880	I didn't care where I went.
3170880	3171840	I just needed to get out.
3172640	3177200	And then when you're in a place of safety, then all of the other stuff starts coming in.
3177920	3180240	Eventually I feel safe here.
3180240	3181120	This is what I want.
3181920	3184400	How do I remain keeping myself safe?
3184400	3185440	Yeah, yeah.
3185440	3187600	Do I get support to go to court?
3187600	3189520	Who helps me if I go to court?
3189520	3190160	Yeah.
3190160	3192080	Do, how do I access legal aid?
3193040	3197200	There is, I know that you're kind of saying you want more of an interface kind of thing,
3197200	3200880	but it is a lot of people would be asked to direct questions.
3201440	3204640	Like, as I said, they're like, how do I access legal aid?
3204640	3205440	Yeah, yeah.
3206320	3206560	Yeah.
3207520	3211200	That's not what you're, I know that we're kind of coming at it from different angles.
3211200	3216080	No, that is what we're trying to find out is what would people want to ask?
3216080	3216560	Yeah.
3216560	3218000	What they want responses for.
3218000	3224640	So like a lot of my ideas for what it would look like come from my limited understanding
3224640	3227760	from just working on the last project.
3227760	3234000	So we're trying to come to a better understanding of, you know, what it should look like and
3234000	3236000	how people would want to interact with it.
3236640	3240320	And then the kind of results that they would really need to get back
3240320	3242320	from it that would be most relevant.
3242320	3246720	I think it'd be very good at the very start to get them to a place where they're safe.
3246720	3249680	Then they'd forget about it until they want to move on.
3249680	3250400	Yeah.
3250400	3252720	And then that's when they'll come back and help me the first time,
3252720	3253920	they might help me this time.
3253920	3254800	Yeah, yeah.
3255600	3258320	So getting them to a place where they're safe.
3258320	3258640	Yes.
3258640	3259760	Is that the primary?
3259760	3260720	That's the main thing.
3260720	3263920	That's the main thing and the main reason for this as well.
3263920	3264240	Yeah.
3264240	3264960	Okay.
3264960	3266320	Where they feel safe.
3266320	3273040	And you came up with some websites that we hadn't come across before, but is there like a
3274000	3280000	a list of even just for Galway and people that you would deal with,
3280640	3284480	is there like a list of websites or organizations?
3284480	3287920	Oh yes, I came in with lots of them.
3287920	3289120	You wrote some of his papers.
3289120	3289600	Yeah, yeah.
3290320	3294480	Tell me what you want and what I can get for you and we'll see where we can go from there.
3302240	3302800	Websites.
3303920	3306480	I've never heard of that Carb Haven Family Hub now.
3308800	3311440	Is that a residential place?
3314880	3315600	Carb Haven.
3316880	3318480	Supported temporary accommodation.
3319760	3323200	Ten families experience homelessness in Galway City.
3323200	3324160	Oh, it's homelessness.
3324160	3326720	That's that domestic violence relation to the club.
3328720	3330480	Unless I suppose you're homeless as a result.
3330480	3330880	Okay.
3330960	3331520	Okay.
3334640	3336080	We started to get in there nowadays.
3340560	3341120	It's awful.
3342160	3348320	When you see the the care and then when you're a male, the one question I said,
3348320	3351280	I ignore would you prefer a female staff member to come collect you?
3352800	3353360	Yeah, so.
3356720	3357600	This is a great thing.
3357600	3359600	If you get lost growing, you'll be nervous.
3359680	3366800	Yeah, so really it's a chatbot and you know we're using it here on a laptop and
3367680	3373520	you know if we got it in a position that it was useful, you could embed it in anything.
3373520	3378800	So, you know, if you thought it was a good idea to turn it into an app once we've
3379360	3381760	got something that doesn't have everything.
3381760	3382880	We even have the server though.
3382880	3383280	Yeah.
3383280	3384240	But we'll shake it out.
3384560	3385060	Yeah.
3387280	3388640	We have that for the whole server.
3388640	3389680	I didn't get the server.
3394560	3396880	That thing I sent out to you wasn't your completion.
3398000	3398720	Don't see this.
3398720	3402400	The answer since that's a sit on to you as well.
3403200	3404880	I didn't go into the code myself.
3404880	3407840	I couldn't even do where to go with that.
3409360	3409600	Yeah.
3410960	3412240	It was it was complete.
3412240	3413200	It was completed.
3413200	3413920	Yeah.
3414880	3420560	Two little things that you had to finish and then that's what it all does well.
3420560	3422240	I was disappointed how that ended up.
3422240	3422740	Yeah.
3428160	3434240	Okay, so is there anything, so I think a list of websites that we obviously haven't included.
3434240	3437840	Yeah, or maybe like some PDF file.
3438720	3443680	But like the store this information.
3445920	3446420	No, no.
3446960	3448080	The website is now.
3451120	3454080	No, I mean, because like you can scrape it once you have two websites.
3454080	3454640	Yeah, yeah.
3454640	3462080	I mean, this information are all from the website.
3462160	3471680	I mean, if they are all if they some of them also like some PDF file, some like legal file, some.
3472880	3477520	So so like documents that you might provide people with information, is it?
3478640	3483440	No, I mean, like the government will have some documents.
3484000	3484500	Okay.
3484980	3488340	No documents about these things.
3489300	3491940	Like, do I need that?
3492820	3497780	Do I need to extract information from that?
3498820	3504500	So I'm thinking just there's a lot of stuff on the app that you could pull from it.
3504500	3506420	There was a lot of good information that was on that.
3507140	3507540	Yeah.
3507540	3509220	If you can open the code, I don't know.
3510020	3512100	Yeah, that's your baby.
3512100	3512600	Yeah.
3513160	3515320	There was a question sent you that already.
3517400	3520520	The previous app had a database.
3520520	3521080	Yeah, yeah.
3521080	3521580	Yeah.
3521960	3525000	There was a lot of information on that that would fit into that as well.
3525560	3526060	Yeah.
3526120	3526620	Yeah.
3526840	3527340	Okay.
3528520	3530200	So yeah, that's that's something that.
3530200	3530700	Yeah.
3531960	3536280	Even the headings of it, if you create just a question around the headings that were on it.
3536920	3537420	Yeah.
3537900	3541020	I think we have a list of all those are broken down.
3541740	3542780	That's where it is.
3542780	3543280	Yeah.
3543280	3546540	All the websites associated with each and they're broken down.
3548540	3549040	There.
3549260	3550140	That's where they are.
3550140	3550640	Yeah.
3551340	3551840	Yeah.
3553340	3554540	I'll have a look at that again.
3554540	3555040	Yeah.
3555580	3558220	That's what it says to me for doing there.
3558220	3558940	It's there.
3558940	3559440	Yeah.
3559660	3560160	Okay.
3560300	3560800	Yeah.
3561180	3563660	I just broke it down sections or the housing sections.
3564540	3565040	Yeah.
3565200	3568960	There's a lot of contact details over there with a lot of services on this.
3568960	3569460	Yeah.
3569460	3572240	Don't know why I don't have it on, but it's the haven I've ever heard of that.
3572240	3574240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3574240	3577840	And we've probably had some of that kind of how or what.
3577840	3578640	Yes, good idea.
3578640	3579600	It was all that.
3579600	3581760	How do you know you're in a vital relationship?
3581760	3582260	Yeah.
3582400	3582900	Yeah.
3582960	3586960	And I know that that was a questionnaire, but they could become questions for that as well.
3588160	3588660	Yeah.
3588720	3590480	The more questions you give it the better.
3590480	3591280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3591280	3591780	Yeah.
3594400	3596160	What about testimonials?
3596880	3599040	I think that would be useful to try and get some...
3599040	3600960	I can follow up with them while I get...
3600960	3601460	Yeah.
3601460	3605280	Now, what they'll give me is like, like you're talking about testimonials of a...
3606720	3610160	I'm talking about testimonials of like four or five lines and that's all you'll get now.
3610160	3610660	Okay.
3613120	3614000	Yeah, no, that's probably...
3614000	3615360	In the testimonial books...
3616720	3619840	You want the testimonials that gonna tell you...
3621440	3622240	What worked for them.
3622240	3624240	You want a three or four page answer.
3624240	3625360	What worked for you.
3625360	3625860	Yeah.
3626080	3626580	Yeah.
3626800	3631760	So that then that's kind of knowledge then that can be extracted that, you know,
3632320	3636480	these services were important in this situation, that kind of thing.
3638800	3644320	So, yeah, if you kind of can get any of those sort of following up anyway...
3644320	3644820	Yes.
3645040	3646400	Not, we'll just have to...
3646400	3648560	That's enough to see what's going back.
3648560	3649060	Yeah.
3649440	3649940	Okay.
3650820	3653700	If you can take those questions that are on that,
3654580	3658180	what you would up there, the tangent there, all these questions.
3658180	3661540	If you can get these off that, send them on to me as well.
3661540	3662040	Right.
3662040	3666020	I can ask a few of the victims, the survivors that we have.
3666020	3666520	Yeah.
3666520	3668180	A few of the questions in relation to that.
3668180	3668680	Yeah.
3668980	3669480	Yeah.
3669480	3669980	Okay.
3670220	3670720	Yeah.
3670820	3671540	That could be.
3671540	3672040	Yeah.
3672580	3674820	If you can remember them or you can just get them off that.
3674820	3675320	Yeah.
3675780	3676280	Okay.
3676660	3677160	Yeah.
3677160	3678100	I'll have to think about that.
3678100	3678600	Yeah.
3678820	3679320	That's it.
3679320	3683720	Whatever you want from the thing and all it can do is go and ask them.
3683720	3684220	Yeah.
3684220	3685000	That's the main thing.
3685000	3695080	And I think that the next step then is keep working on it and we'll play around with the
3695080	3700360	models themselves and the output they produce and at some point we might go to you or get
3700360	3704840	the information again and just kind of show you some different options that we've come
3704840	3708760	up with for responses and just see which ones make sense and which ones don't.
3708760	3709260	Yeah.
3709480	3711480	I'll bring one of my colleagues with me today.
3711480	3713080	I tried to bring her today.
3713080	3717400	She couldn't have got a new worker and her previous worker today was, she was just the
3717400	3719400	best she finds a poor person for too long.
3719400	3720120	Oh right.
3720120	3720620	So.
3720760	3721260	Yeah.
3721260	3722760	She would have been very useful to have.
3722760	3723260	Yeah.
3723260	3724760	So I will bring her with me the next time.
3724760	3725260	Yeah.
3725260	3725760	Okay.
3725760	3726260	Yeah.
3726260	3726760	Yeah.
3726760	3727260	Brilliant.
3727260	3728260	That sounds good.
3728260	3728760	Yeah.
3728760	3729260	Yeah.
3729260	3729760	It's okay?
3729760	3730260	Sounds good.
3730260	3730760	Yeah.
3730760	3731260	Nice to meet you.
3731260	3731760	Thanks a million.
3731760	3732260	Adrian.
3732260	3732760	Be in touch?
3732760	3733260	Yeah.
3733260	3733760	Okay.
3733760	3734260	See you later.
3734260	3734760	See you guys.
3734760	3735260	Bye.
3735260	3735760	Have a nice day.
3739320	3739820	Bye.
3769820	3770820	Now I don't know.
3770820	3771320	Yeah.
3771320	3772320	What we need to looks like.
3772320	3772820	Yeah.
3772820	3773320	Yeah.
3773320	3773820	Yeah.
3773820	3774320	Maybe it's useful.
3774320	3775820	Maybe it's not so useful.
3775820	3776320	Yeah.
3776320	3776820	Yeah.
3776820	3777320	But we will see.
3777320	3777820	Yeah.
3777820	3778320	Yeah.
3778320	3778820	I think.
3778820	3779320	Yeah.
3779320	3779820	Definitely.
3779820	3787320	I think we need to test that and maybe that's about having, having another version that
3787320	3792320	has a repository of testimonials included and version that doesn't.
3792320	3793320	Oh yeah.
3793320	3794320	Yes.
3794320	3794820	Yes.
3794820	3796320	That makes any difference.
3797320	3803320	Now I think the, the data part, we, we get this back.
3803320	3805320	I need to look into it.
3805320	3806320	Yeah.
3809320	3814320	I think there's some insight there.
3814320	3820320	We'll, we'll have a look at that data from the app again and see if that's something
3820320	3824320	that we can use and it might give us information on websites that then you could add to your
3824320	3826320	scraping tool.
3826320	3836320	Um, and I think then we could look at structuring those responses and the, the main things.
3836320	3846320	So somebody asks a question, say, um, you know, can I get support or what support I
3846320	3847320	can get?
3847320	3855320	And then we probably need a breakdown of what the support is, why the support is relevant,
3855320	3860320	what they can get out of it, what the outcomes are, um, rather than just their query.
3860320	3867320	I think we can augment it to, to try and include those data in the response as well.
3867320	3868320	Yes.
3868320	3877320	And also now the chatbot, the end of chatbot, it will not ask, try, it will not try to ask,
3877320	3884320	like try to narrow down your, the, the, like if you are a man or woman.
3884320	3885320	Yeah.
3885320	3886320	Yeah.
3886320	3889320	So the chatbot should narrow down.
3889320	3897320	But, but, but how deep should the chatbot ask?
3897320	3901320	Like I ask you if a man or woman.
3901320	3906320	And next question, do I need to ask your age range?
3906320	3915320	Like if a young male or old man, then you can ask more detailed question.
3915320	3919320	So how deep should the chatbot ask?
3919320	3929320	I think the only, the only significant difference there is whether they're a child or an adult.
3929320	3930320	Okay.
3930320	3931320	I don't think age would matter beyond that.
3931320	3932320	Okay.
3932320	3933320	Okay.
3933320	3934320	That's, that's easier.
3934320	3935320	Yeah.
3935320	3936320	You don't have to.
3936320	3937320	Yeah.
3937320	3938320	Okay.
3939320	3948320	Like on those websites that you're scraping, um, maybe it's worth trying to pick out tokens
3948320	3960320	for, you know, gender or children versus adults and to try and use that to categorize or classify
3960320	3963320	some of the information and who it's relevant for.
3963320	3967320	And those could give you things then that might be follow-up prompts or things that
3967320	3974320	you can emphasize in the responses that, um, you know, if there's stuff that's just for
3974320	3980320	children, if there's stuff that, um, is for men specifically, then those could be things
3980320	3984320	that you could, yeah, bring out more in the responses.
3984320	3985320	Okay.
3985320	3986320	Okay.
3986320	3996320	Then, um, do you mean like before I put these things into the knowledge base, I do these
3996320	3997320	things before?
3997320	3998320	Yeah.
3998320	3999320	Maybe.
3999320	4001320	Like children or adults.
4001320	4002320	Yeah.
4002320	4005320	But that's, okay.
4006320	4017320	And then, okay, I will, um, try to find if some other project use this, this thing, because
4017320	4024320	from my understanding, like the ritual part, they should already do this.
4024320	4037320	Like if you said, I'm a, I'm a children, I'm a child, and this, uh, the embedding will,
4037320	4046320	will already trust from this sentence into like some number.
4047320	4056320	So the, the ritual part, we already try to find all the children part inside of the knowledge
4056320	4057320	base.
4057320	4058320	Yeah.
4058320	4071320	So I don't need to do the classification because it will, for the retrieval, it's, it's already
4071320	4079320	to the classification because the embedded of children and out is definitely different.
4079320	4080320	Yeah.
4080320	4087320	I suppose what might be useful is if the retrieval part, cause if you ask a general question,
4087320	4093320	then you'll get lots of stuff returned in the retrieval part.
4093320	4098320	But if there's particular embeddings with what's returned, it seemed to be relevant
4098320	4104320	to those are things that probably should be accounted for in the response.
4104320	4109320	Even if that's to kind of say that some of this information is to do with children, some
4109320	4112320	of it is to do with adults.
4112320	4117320	Would you like to kind of, you know, enter it down or something like that.
4117320	4123320	So if there's embeddings and stuff that seemed prominent or relevant and they, those could
4123320	4125320	be the subject to follow up questions or.
4125320	4126320	Yeah.
4126320	4128320	That's, that's what I need to do.
4128320	4132320	The follow up questions part.
4132320	4143320	Now I notice these recent models, they will always ask follow up questions.
4143320	4151320	But previously, let's say one years before, they don't ask these follow up questions.
4151320	4152320	Right.
4152320	4157320	So I think they, they, they also notice what you mentioned.
4157320	4164320	Like if they can narrow down the, the, the, the question, they can give better answers.
4164320	4165320	Yeah.
4165320	4166320	Yeah.
4169320	4170320	Yeah.
4170320	4171320	Generally I think that was useful.
4171320	4172320	Did you find it useful?
4172320	4173320	Yeah.
4173320	4174320	Yeah.
4174320	4175320	Okay.
4175320	4176320	Great.
4176320	4178320	I need to incorporate in this.
4178320	4179320	Yeah.
4179320	4180320	Yeah.
4181320	4187320	Do you want to make some notes on the meeting after you've kind of listened to it back and
4187320	4191320	stuff and just put them on the.
4191320	4193320	Email or Notion?
4193320	4194320	Notion.
4194320	4195320	Yeah.
4195320	4196320	Okay.
4196320	4201320	Put them up there just cause it, it'd be useful just to kind of see those written down.
4201320	4202320	Yeah.
4202320	4207320	I think it's useful for my, the, the paper report.
4207320	4208320	Yeah.
4208320	4209320	Yeah.
4209320	4216320	Actually, I feel regret previously, we have so many meetings.
4216320	4220320	I, I didn't do some enough notes.
4220320	4221320	Oh, right.
4221320	4222320	Okay.
4222320	4223320	Yeah.
4223320	4225320	Well, that was a good time to start.
4225320	4227320	I hope it's not too late.
4227320	4228320	Yeah.
4228320	4229320	Right.
4229320	4230320	Yeah.
4230320	4233320	We'll leave it there cause I have to go.
4233320	4234320	Okay.
4235320	4248320	And we have a meeting in, so yeah, we need to put in a recurring meeting.
4248320	4255320	Um, when would be useful for you to meet again?
4255320	4262320	Um, this week I'll be around on Wednesday, but otherwise it would be online.
4262320	4265320	So maybe if we go to next week.
4265320	4266320	But, but, but what's the point?
4266320	4268320	We meet like two days later.
4268320	4269320	Yeah.
4269320	4270320	That's another point as well.
4270320	4271320	I need to, yeah.
4271320	4272320	Yeah.
4272320	4275320	I got some time to consume all these.
4275320	4278320	Should we go with next Thursday?
4278320	4279320	Yeah.
4279320	4280320	Next Thursday I think.
4280320	4283320	I have one, almost two weeks.
4283320	4284320	Yeah.
4284320	4290320	So if I put a meeting in for 1.30.
4290320	4291320	Okay.
4291320	4292320	Okay.
4292320	4295320	I'll make that a recurring meeting as well.
4295320	4298320	So we don't just run into the same issue again.
4298320	4299320	Oh, okay.
