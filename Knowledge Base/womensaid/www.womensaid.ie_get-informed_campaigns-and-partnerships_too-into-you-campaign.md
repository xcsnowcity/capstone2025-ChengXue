# Too Into You Campaign
Women’s Aid runs the Too Into You campaign which is focused on young people, in particular young women, aged 18-25. The campaign aims to teach young people about the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships, the red flags of relationship abuse, and provide support at our dedicated website for young people [toointoyou.ie](https://www.toointoyou.ie/).

## Get the facts
In Ireland, 1 in 5 young women and 1 in 11 young men aged 18-25 have been abused by their partner or ex. Of the young women subjected to abuse:
  * 51% first experienced the abuse under the age of 18.
  * 9 out of 10 were subjected to emotional abuse.
  * 3 in 4 were sexually coerced. Over half (51%) were sexually assaulted and 27% were raped.
  * 1 in 2 had been targeted with online abuse.
  * 1 in 2 were threatened with physical violence. 1 in 2 experienced ‘less severe’ physical abuse e.g. slapping, shoving. 1 in 3 had experienced more ‘severe’ forms of physical abuse e.g. punching, choking, burning.
  * 32% never spoke to anyone about the abuse they experienced.
