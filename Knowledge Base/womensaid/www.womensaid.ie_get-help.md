# Get Help
Domestic violence and abuse happens to many women. It can affect any woman at any age and from any background. The person abusing you may be your current spouse or partner. Abuse can also continue after a relationship ends. The person abusing you may be another member of your family.
There is no excuse for domestic violence and it is not your fault if it happens to you.
