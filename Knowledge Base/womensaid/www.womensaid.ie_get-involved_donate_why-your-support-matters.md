# Why Your Support Matters
### Now is the moment we can act – together.
Across Ireland one in three women live with suffocating abuse from someone they once loved and trusted. We rarely know it is happening. Or, if we do, we don’t know what to say, or do. But Women’s Aid does.
And we need your help.

Domestic violence. It lives in the shadows. It’s everywhere we turn. It can happen to anyone. By supporting Women’s Aid you can **change lives.** **And save lives.**
##  Susan 
“The worst abuse I suffered – and the turning point for me – came **when I was 26 weeks pregnant.** He went into a rage over what I cooked him for dinner. It was the most frightening night of my life. I felt lost. Powerless. Trapped in hell. I had no one to turn to. **I had no one in my corner – until I turned to Women’s Aid.** And because of their supporters, they were able to help me. **Their kindness has given me and my baby protection.** They’ve helped us survive. They’ve given us a future full of hope and possibilities. **I thank them from the bottom of my heart.** And thank them on behalf of all the other women like me they will help in the future.”
## Your support will help in so many ways
  * More women will be able to access the [National Freephone Helpline](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/talk-to-us/) that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so no matter when a woman makes the call, there is someone at the other end of the line to listen, to help.
  * Women who are abused while they are pregnant can get support from [our dedicated maternity outreach worker.](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/support-services/maternity-outreach/)
  * We can continue our Emergency, Security and Legal Funds for women engaged with [our face-to-face frontline services](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/support-services/), providing an essential lifeline and providing them with some crucial financial independence.
  * We’ll be able continue campaigns like [Too Into You](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/campaigns-and-partnerships/), protecting future generations by educating young people what healthy relationships look like and highlighting the red flags of intimate relationship abuse.
  * And there is so much more we can do with your help.


## Thank you
Your support will bring hope, healing and the possibility of a brighter future for women and children.
