  * Respond to more women when they call the 24hr National Freephone Helpline and need someone to listen to them, to believe them, to help and empower them, without judgement
  * Create new, innovative services in response to the needs of the women who come to us
  * Expand the reach of our services, taking pilot projects such as our Maternity programme from being regional to having national coverage.


And so much more.

###  Geoff Sparling, Chief Customer Officer, Allianz 
“As part of our commitment to sustainability we want to work alongside organisations to make a meaningful difference for society and the communities we are part of.

###  Gary Grant, Imbibe Coffee Roasters 
“We’ve donated 1% of every coffee sale to Women’s Aid since the day we opened the roastery. We are extremely proud to directly support an organisation that is making a real difference to the lives of women and children across Ireland.”
