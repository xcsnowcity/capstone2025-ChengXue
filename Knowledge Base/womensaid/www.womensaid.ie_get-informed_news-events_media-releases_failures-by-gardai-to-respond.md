# Media Release: Failures by Gardai to respond to 999 calls from domestic violence victims are of deep concern – Women’s Aid
![](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2023/05/160331553132636610.jpg)
**Saturday 12th June 2021:** Women’s Aid, a leading national support organisation for victims of domestic violence including coercive control, has said that media reports about failures by Gardaí to respond to 999 calls from domestic violence victims are of deep concern. The Gardaí are a key frontline responder to combating and preventing the scourge of domestic abuse in Ireland, and public trust in their response is absolutely vital.
Sarah Benson, CEO of Women’s Aid, says:
> “At the present moment what is of critical importance is that there is a swift, sensitive and systematic outreach to those whose calls went unanswered; to assess their safety and support needs. A complete root and branch revision of internal systems and practices must also be completed to ensure that such a grievous breach of procedure can never happen again. All members of the Gardaí must be reminded of their responsibilities under the Garda Domestic Abuse Policy and held to this standard. We have been given assurance that these actions are current high priorities for An Garda Síochána.”
Women’s Aid remains available to anyone impacted by domestic abuse 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through the National Freephone Helpline 1800 341 900 to listen, believe and offer support and referral, if required, to all specialist services nationwide.
Ends.
