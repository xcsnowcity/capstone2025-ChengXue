# Ways to Fundraise
One in four women in Ireland is affected by domestic violence. Your fundraising enables us to continue to be there for the next woman who needs our support. We’ve helped thousands of women and their children to live safer, happier lives, free from abuse, thanks to the wonderful people who fundraise on our behalf.
There are lots of ways to fundraise for Women’s Aid, and whatever you do, we’ll be there to support you every step of the way.
