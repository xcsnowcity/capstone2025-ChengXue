## Domestic abuse is more common than you think. 
### [Domestic Violence and Abuse in Ireland](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/facts/#collapse0)
  * 35% of women in Ireland, more than one in three, have now experienced psychological, physical and/or sexual abuse from an intimate partner. [(EU gender-based violence survey, Fundamental Rights Agency, 2024)](https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2024/eu-gender-violence-survey-key-results)

  * One in four (25%) women in Ireland experienced sexual violence as an adult with a partner.


([CSO Sexual Violence Survey 2023](https://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/crimeandjustice/sexualviolencesurvey/sexualviolencesurveyarchive2023/)).
  * An Garda Síochána responded to over 65,000 domestic abuse incidents in 2024, which translates to an average of 1,250 incidents every week.


[ (An Garda Síochána, 2025)](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41561812.html).
### [The International Context](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/facts/#collapse1)
  * 31.8% of women in the EU have experienced psychological, physical and/or sexual abuse from an intimate partner in their lifetime. [(EU gender-based violence survey, Fundamental Rights Agency, 2024)](https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2024/eu-gender-violence-survey-key-results)
  * 1 in 3 women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence, mostly by an intimate partner ([UN Women](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women), 2021)
  * Fewer than 40% of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort ([UN Women](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures), 2015)
  * 42% of women who experience intimate partner violence report an injury as a consequence of this violence ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women), 2013)


### [Domestic Abuse: An Issue of Gender](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/facts/#collapse2)
  * According to the [Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence: A Report on Crime Levels and Garda Operational Responses, 2022](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/our-departments/office-of-corporate-communications/news-media/an-garda-siochana-domestic-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-report-sept-22.pdf): 
    * Males and females experience violent and threatening crimes differently. For female victims, there is a close link between domestic abuse and sexual/other types of violence. A domestic abuse motive was recorded for 90% of all females who were victims of Murder/Manslaughter/Infanticide and 43% of all females who were victims of Attempts/Threats to Murder, Assaults, Harassments and Related Offences between 2019 and 2021. Male victims, whilst also experiencing domestic abuse, are more likely to be subject to violence by offenders unknown to them and/or in incidents not relating to domestic abuse
    * The offender is male in the majority of incidents with a female victim (74%). When the victim is male, the offender is also male for the majority (88%)
    * For the sub-set of incidents where the Victim Offender Relationship is available, female victims are more likely than males to know the offender (84% of female victims compared to 61% of male victims)
  * The 2005 National Crime Council and ESRI research into the domestic abuse of women and men in Ireland found that 1 in 7 women in Ireland compared to 1 in 17 men experience severe domestic violence. Women are over twice as likely as men to have experienced severe physical abuse, seven times more likely to have experienced sexual abuse, and are more likely to experience serious injuries than men. According to the research, women are twice as likely to be injured as a result of domestic abuse; more likely to experience serious injuries; more likely to require medical attention as a result of abuse; and the impact of the abuse in terms of fear, distress and health impacts is more significant for women than men. ([NCC & ERSI, 2005](https://www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/BKMNEXT56.pdf))


### [Femicide](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/facts/#collapse3)
  * Globally, 85,000 women and girls were killed intentionally in 2023 – 60% of these homicides (51,100) were committed by an intimate partner or a family member.

  * Everyday 140 women and girls are killed by an intimate partner or other members of their family ([Femicides in 2023, UN Women, 2024](https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/femicides-in-2023-global-estimates-of-intimate-partner-family-member-femicides-en.pdf))
  * Since 1996, 275 women have died violently in the Republic of Ireland (up to 3rd March 2025). 
    * Of the women that were killed: 
      * 63% were killed in their own homes.
      * 55% were killed by a partner or ex (of the resolved cases)
      * Almost 9 in 10 women knew their killer


([Women’s Aid Femicide Watch 1996-2025](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2025/03/Womens-Aid-Femicide-Watch-1996-2025.pdf))
  * In Ireland, murders overall have fallen over time, but the proportion of those with a domestic abuse motivation represented the majority of murders (52%) for the first time in 2021. ([Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence: A Report on Crime Levels and Garda Operational Responses, 2022](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/our-departments/office-of-corporate-communications/news-media/an-garda-siochana-domestic-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-report-sept-22.pdf))

  * The Irish national estimated cost of domestic violence and abuse over a woman’s journey to safety (an average of 20.5 years) is €56 billion ([Safe Ireland and NUIG](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/Assessing-the-Social-and-Economic-Costs-of-DV-July2021.pdf), 2021)
  * EIGE has estimated that the cost of gender-based violence across the EU is €366 billion a year. Violence against women makes up 79 % of this cost, amounting to €289 billion. Intimate partner violence makes up almost half (48 %, €174 billion) of the cost of gender based violence. Intimate partner violence against women makes up 87 % of this sum (€151 billion) ([EIGE](https://eige.europa.eu/gender-based-violence/costs-of-gender-based-violence-in-eu), 2021)

([Focus Ireland 2023](https://www.focusireland.ie/focus-blog/shining-a-spotlight-on-womens-homelessness-this-iwd2023/#_ftnref3))
  * However, homelessness among women is thought to be undercounted because of the ways it is counted. ([Eurocities Homeless Women Count](https://eurocities.eu/latest/homeless-women-count/) and [Focus Ireland 2024](https://www.simon.ie/the-invisibility-of-womens-homelessness/))
  * On average, 180 women and 275 children seek emergency accommodation every month and in 2021 more than 3,000 requests for refuge could not be met by services. ([Safe Ireland](https://www.safeireland.ie/policy-publications/), 2023)

(2020). _Domestic violence and pregnancy in Ireland: Women’s routes to seeking help and safety_. Trinity College Dublin. School of Social Work & Social Policy. Discipline of Social Studies.)](https://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/91289/Sioba%cc%81n%20O%27Brien%20Green%20TCD%20PhD%20Thesis%20Final%20January%202020.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y)

  * In 2020, it was estimated that 1 in 2 young women experienced gender-based cyber violence. 76% of women said they changed the way they use social media after experiencing cyber harassment, of which online hate speech is a form, and 32% said they ceased posting their opinions on certain issues ([European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE)](https://eige.europa.eu/publications/combating-cyber-violence-against-women-and-girls), 2022)
  * In the Women’s Aid (2020) [One in Five Report](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2023/04/One-in-Five-Youn-Women-Report-2020.pdf) we found that of the one in five young women who suffered abuse from a partner or ex, 49% suffered online abuse
  * It is estimated that globally, 1 in 10 women has experienced at least one form of cyber violence since the age of 15 ([European Institute for Gender Equality](https://eige.europa.eu/publications/cyber-violence-against-women-and-girls), 2017)
  * Women (particularly young women aged 18 – 24) disproportionately experience severe types of cyber harassment, such as cyber stalking and online sexual harassment in many cases at the hands of partners and ex-partners ([European Institute for Gender Equality](https://eige.europa.eu/publications/cyber-violence-against-women-and-girls), 2017)
  * The [Women’s Aid Federation of England research](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/online-safety/) (2019) on online domestic violence and abuse found that: 
    * For 85% of respondents the abuse they received online from a partner or ex-partner was part of a pattern of abuse they also experienced offline
