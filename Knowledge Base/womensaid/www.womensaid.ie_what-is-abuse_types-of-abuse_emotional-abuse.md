# Emotional Abuse
Emotional abuse is a very common form of abuse. It is abuse that might not be physical but is hurtful in other ways. It is as harmful as physical abuse but it can be hard to name and talk about. Other people might not be able to see the abuse and this can feel lonely.

Emotional abuse can make a relationship very unequal. It can seem as though the abusive person has all the power. Emotional abuse can happen at the same time as other kinds of abuse and can include threats of violence. 
## Emotional abuse is when your partner or ex-partner:
  * Isolates you from friends and family
  * Calls you names and verbally abuses you
  * Stalks and monitors you both physically and online
  * Threatens to hurt or kill you, themselves, your children or your family or friends
  * Deprives you of sleep as a tactic of abuse
  * Steals and/or destroys your property and belongings
  * Forbids you from having any social media accounts
  * Does not let you leave home without them
  * Takes away your car keys or your access to a car
  * Damages your bond with your children by by manipulating and encouraging children to join in on abuse against you
  * Refuses to admit or acknowledge abuse shortly after it has happened (gaslighting)
  * Threatens to reveal your residency and visa status to authorities if you are not legally living in Ireland
  * Prevents you from seeking family planning advice and access to medical treatment
