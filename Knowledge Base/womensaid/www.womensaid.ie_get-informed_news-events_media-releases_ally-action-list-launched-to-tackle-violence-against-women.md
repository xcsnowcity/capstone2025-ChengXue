# ‘Ally Action List’ launched to tackle violence against women
**Allianz and Women’s Aid launch new online resource for men on how to help address violence against women**
  * **A** ctively reflect on your attitudes
  * **L** ean into positive norms
  * **L** isten to, learn from and support women
  * **Y** ou and your community, working together


12th February 2025: In an effort to highlight and tackle the endemic societal issue of male violence against women in Ireland, Allianz and Women’s Aid have today launched, the ‘Ally Action List’.
The Ally Action List is an online resource that aims to help men better understand how they can become allies in ending gender inequality and gender-based violence and how they can adopt more supportive attitudes and behaviours, moving Ireland closer towards a zero tolerance society. Research, conducted by Women’s Aid and Core*, shows that despite many men wanting to help, a key barrier is that they are not sure how. The Ally Action List is a practical guide to being a male ally, with the aim of removing that barrier.
Speaking today, Women’s Aid CEO, Sarah Benson, said:
“Violence and abuse against women, including femicide figures are going in the wrong direction and that needs to change as a matter of urgency. Already this year, three women have lost their lives in violent circumstances. Our research shows that we need men to join the conversation and while a majority want to help, they aren’t always sure where to start. Together with Allianz, we are launching the Ally Action List to provide clear, practical steps to invite men into the conversation in becoming effective allies. This isn’t about judgement or pointing fingers – it’s about specific, actionable ways for men to make a difference. 64% of men in Ireland agree that men should call out inappropriate jokes or comments about women, so the foundation is there for all of us to drive change.”
The launch of the Ally Action List comes as research** shows that 35% of women in Ireland, more than 1 in 3, have experienced psychological, physical and / or sexual abuse from an intimate partner. Figures recently released by An Garda Síochána*** also revealed that reports of domestic abuse increased by 9% in 2024, totalling 65,114.
Designed to reverse this trend, the Allianz and Women’s Aid Ally Action List is built around four key pillars:
  1. **Actively reflect on your attitudes**


  * Think about the kind of man you want to be
  * Reflect on your own actions
  * Show strength by being open and real2. **Lean into positive norms**
  * Be open to conversations about masculinity
  * Embrace and promote positive ideas about masculinity
  * Speak up when you hear sexist comments
  * Step in when you see something wrong3. **Listen to, learn from and support women**
  * Support women by standing with them
  * You don’t have to fix everything
  * Share care and household responsibilities equally in your relationship4. **You and your community, working together**
  * Be the role model you once had
  * Get involved in the movement for change


As part of the launch of the Ally Action List and the need to drive awareness of the urgency for men to get involved in this issue, Allianz and Women’s Aid will open the doors of **‘The Dead Flower Shop’** this Valentine’s Day, Friday 14th February, located at 110 Grafton Street, Dublin 2.
“Valentine’s Day is the one day that men are collectively thinking about their partners. We are opening The Dead Flower Shop to leverage that collective focus to highlight the very real and growing issue of violence against women and femicide. As men enter flower shops across the country, to buy Valentine’s Day flowers for their partners, The Dead Flower Shop will be a reminder of women who were killed by theirs,” said Sarah Benson.
Open to the public for one day only, The Dead Flower Shop will look like a normal flower shop but, once people enter, they will see an exhibition of dead flowers. Eight bouquets have been designed and arranged to represent a select number of women in Ireland who have been killed by their current or former partners. At the centre of the exhibition, a larger bouquet of 274 dead roses will collectively represent and remember each of the 274 women killed in violence circumstances in Ireland since 1996.
Speaking about the campaign, Phillip Gronemeyer, Allianz CEO, said:
“We have been a Women’s Aid partner for over three years now and never have we seen a more urgent need to address attitudes and behaviours. Violence against women is increasing and we are all too aware of the shocking number of femicide cases that have dominated the news in recent times. It is only by our community as a whole coming together that we can drive the positive change needed to shift the dial on violence against women so we would like more men to get involved.
Working closely with Women’s Aid with the additional support of the Men’s Development Network, we have developed the Ally Action List. We are calling on men across the country to engage with the resource and encouraging them to become more aware of what part they can play when it comes to ending violence against women. We’ve shared this resource with our employees at Allianz and encourage other business leaders to do the same.”
The Ally Action List is available at womensaid.ie/men.
