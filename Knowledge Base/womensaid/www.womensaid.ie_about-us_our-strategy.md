## Our Purpose
Women’s Aid is a national, feminist organisation working to prevent and address the impact of domestic violence and abuse including coercive control, in Ireland since 1974.
### We do this by:
  * advocating, influencing, training, and campaigning for effective responses to prevent and reduce the scale and impacts of domestic violence and abuse on women and children in Ireland
  * providing high quality, specialised, integrated, support services.


## Our Vision
Women’s Aid’s vision is an equal Ireland, with zero tolerance of domestic abuse and all other forms of violence against women.
## **Our Values**
To achieve our purpose and vision of zero tolerance of domestic abuse and all forms of violence against women, Women’s Aid:
  * Acts with **courage** to boldly challenge patriarchal systems, structures and attitudes in all aspect of our work.
  * Works in **co-operation** to share knowledge, skills and expertise to achieve shared goals and improve responses to domestic violence and abuse.
  * Strives to embed **inclusivity** , diversity and accessibility across all our work.
  * Seeks the **empowerment of** women to exercise agency on their own behalf as a right, whatever their circumstances.
  * Believes that achieving **equality** in status, rights and opportunities for all women is essential to address the causes and consequences of domestic violence and abuse.
  * Works to achieve positive **change** for everyone through a combination of individual, community-based and social action.


## Our Strategic Priorities
Our strategic priorities are based on a strong dedication to the women we serve and an unwavering focus on bringing about the social changes in Ireland that will deliver our vision. During the period 2025-2029, we have framed our plan around three strategic priorities:
  1. Creating Social Equality
  2. Building and Nurturing Effective Partnerships
  3. Continually Strengthening Capability and Expertise
