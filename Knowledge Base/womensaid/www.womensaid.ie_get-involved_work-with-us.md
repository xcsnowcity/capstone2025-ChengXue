The High Risk Support Project (HRSP) provides a multi-agency response to women at high risk of ongoing abuse and homicide from their ex-partners.

Women’s Aid partners with An Garda Síochána local domestic abuse services to deliver a coordinated rapid response system for women and families. The High Risk Support Project supports and empowers women to feel safer and to begin rebuilding their lives free of constant fear.
