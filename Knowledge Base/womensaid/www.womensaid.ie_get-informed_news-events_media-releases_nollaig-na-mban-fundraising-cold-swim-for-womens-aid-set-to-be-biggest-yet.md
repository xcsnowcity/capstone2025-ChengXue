# Nollaig na mBan fundraising Cold Swim for Women’s Aid set to be biggest yet
_Women’s Aid, which supports victims of domestic violence and abuse, is calling on the public to take on a Cold Swim for Women this Nollaig na mBan and help ensure that generations of women and children in Ireland are free from the terror of domestic violence._
**12 December 2024:** Women’s Aid is calling on people all over Ireland to get their family, friends and neighbours together this Nollaig na mBan to take part in a Cold Swim for Women and raise funds to support women and children victims-survivors of domestic violence and abuse.
The national frontline organisation, which works to prevent and address the impact of domestic violence and abuse, is expecting some 5,000 brave supporters to do a cold swim as part of the fundraising event.
Those wishing to take part can simply register to fundraise on the Women’s Aid website and get a group together, or take a solo cold dip, at their chosen swimming spot at any time on Nollaig na mBan (January 6).
It is traditional in Ireland for women to get together on this day, but Women’s Aid is encouraging everyone to get involved and enjoy the fun while raising funds or donating to the charity.
Everyone who registers will receive a free Women’s Aid lilac woolly hat to help them warm up after the swim and to show that they’ve taken part and supported women subjected to domestic violence.
**Women’s Aid CEO, Sarah Benson said:** “This is the third year of our Cold Swim for Women and we want to make it the biggest and best yet. This was a really important fundraiser for the organisation last year, and we hope to make that happen again this year. Nollaig na mBan is such a special day to many people across Ireland and we’re delighted that so many have embraced the idea of using the Cold Swim to get together with people they love and help raise funds for our work supporting women subjected to domestic violence and abuse. We know many will use the event as an opportunity to have a coffee and a chat afterwards and check in with friends and families after the festive period, and we would love to see as many people as possible getting involved.”
**Speaking of Women’s Aid’s work, which events like this help support, Ms Benson continued:** “Support workers on our 24 hour National Freephone Helpline, and our face-to-face services, hear from women reporting violence and abuse including assaults; constant surveillance and monitoring; relentless put downs and humiliations; the taking and sharing of intimate images online; complete control over all family finances; sexual assault, rape, and being threatened with theirs or their children’s lives. Every five minutes a woman reaches out to Women’s Aid for support, and everyone who supports us helps ensure we are always there for victims-survivors of domestic abuse when they need us.”
