# Stand Strong: Women’s Aid, Allianz Insurance and the GAA come together to support women experiencing domestic violence.
**2.30pm, Thursday 11 th January 2024: **Women’s Aid and Allianz Insurance are asking people across Ireland to take part in a powerful demonstration of solidarity and support for those subjected to abuse in February 2024. The GAA is hosting the launch and sharing it with the GAA community across Ireland. 
The campaign aims to raise awareness and essential funds for the thousands of women every year that contact Women’s Aid for support. It’s an action that requires no training or preparation. Just Stand Strong in the warrior yoga pose, donate or fundraise with colleagues, family, or friends, and share pictures on social media using the campaign hashtag #WAStandStrong. 
Speaking about Stand Strong CEO of Women’s Aid Sarah Benson commented:
‘’Showing solidarity with women, listening, and believing is a key part of our work, Stand Strong is a powerful but simple action to reflect that one in four women in this country lives with suffocating abuse from someone they once loved; someone they once trusted. It could be anyone: your best friend; your sister; your colleague; your neighbour; your teammate; your mother; your daughter. Anyone. Last year women’s aid had our busiest year in our 50-year history. The Gardaí responded to over 54,000 to domestic abuse calls last year. And we know these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.”
Ms Benson continued: 
“The Stand Strong campaign is designed with three simple actions – Stand Strong, Support and Share. It can be done in a group, with a team or club or by yourself. In your office or at home. By having as many people as take part, we aim to drive greater awareness of the issue of domestic abuse. By sharing and supporting the campaign we raise awareness and vital funds. Someone contacts us every five minutes and everything raised from the campaign really will support women across Ireland.”
To thank those who show their support, Women’s Aid are offering some exclusive campaign goodies such as retro sweatbands and temporary tattoos to people that sign up early via [www.standstrong.ie](http://mhq146link.womensaid.ie/ls/click?upn=uB2iEuKvlWVwjfmRZ6Hgt2X9yqmq0QjGhd53ki7eFamWnJ8jSxy8nhVvq45qB5zlV31Y_Zf9noBSXp6zmd8gcAmse0IZ-2FgEkbwhfWSEV-2BFT1XPWWGhnd7gwet-2BJ4UPc6ZdOUJpLEmhcqsSw6thIW3mFMPM4XlDNsALvG-2BiY6ynjFrpFwazTnO7n-2BjTcdv6mjdowAuXq-2F7TdVSl6s3rEjGbGULQYAwM6jLs5sobWLLqs8eaQFC8jLfpLHD0okBvKpFcojbRb5d1Slq-2BDjceUwEPp9IpebuIrOurH3WL8QUCIE6SKE-3D) and there is other campaign merchandise items on offer for top fundraisers. Due to the generous support of Allianz, all money raised will go directly to Women’s Aid supporting women subjected to domestic abuse. 
Speaking at the launch of Stand Strong 2024, Geoff Sparling, Chief Customer Officer with Allianz added:
“Protection is at the core of insurance, and Allianz’s purpose is securing people’s future, and giving them courage for what is ahead. We are delighted to support Stand Strong once again this year which supports the vital work of Women’s Aid. We want to inspire people across Ireland to take a moment out of their day to show solidarity, raise vital funds and raise awareness. We believe strongly that abuse is never acceptable, and we are committed to doing our part to spread that message.” 
Larry McCarthy, Uachtarán Chumann Lúthcleas Gael, speaking at the launch at Croke Park said:
“We are delighted to support Stand Strong and work with our partners Women’s Aid and Allianz Insurance. On the basis that we need to improve the circumstances of our daughters, our sisters, and our mothers, at the Annual GAA Congress we asked all our clubs to take the time to talk to their teams about respecting their female friends. It was a simple uncomplicated message, Respect Women. The Stand Strong message is similarly uncomplicated. We encourage as many people as possible, particularly GAA members, to take part.”
