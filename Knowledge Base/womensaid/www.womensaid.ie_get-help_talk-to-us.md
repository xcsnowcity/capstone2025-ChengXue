# Talk to Us
It can be hard to talk about what is happening to you if you are being abused, but the **Women’s Aid National Freephone Helpline is here to help, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.**
Often when women call us for the first time they don’t speak as they may be afraid or ashamed.
We understand if you cannot speak today, we are still there to listen and provide support when you are ready.

## **How often can I call the Helpline?**
You can call the Helpline as many times as you need to avail of support.
## **Why can’t I get through on the Helpline?**
If you ring and cannot reach us, it is because our Support Workers are busy on calls with other women. If you don’t get a response straight away, you will be placed in a call answering queue until a support worker becomes available.
## **Will the Helpline number show up on my phone bill?**
We cannot guarantee that the number will not appear on your phone bill, you will need to contact the service provider to check this. The number may also appear in the call log of your mobile phone. [Learn about phone safety here](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-help/your-rights-options/digital-safety/).
## **I’m being charged for the call. What do I do?**
If you are being charged when calling the Helpline from a mobile phone, notify the Support Worker who answers your call, and they will call you back if this is safe for you. Afterwards call your mobile service provider to request that these charges are taken off, and that you are no longer charged for 1800 numbers.
At times, new phones come with an automatic block on 1800 numbers. If you think you are blocked, call your mobile phone provider and ask to have the block removed, which they should be able to do straight away.
