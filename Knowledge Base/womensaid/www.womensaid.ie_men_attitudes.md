# Ally Action List
Women’s Aid and Allianz are calling on men to become allies in ending gender inequality and gender-based violence with the launch of the Ally Action List. Many men want to help, but society hasn’t always made it clear what true allyship looks like. That’s why we’ve created this straightforward, practical guide to show how men can play a key role in this movement and turn good intentions into real, meaningful action.

##  Actively reflect on your attitudes ​ 
![](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2025/02/allies-book.png)
### Did you know…
64% of men in Ireland agree that men should call out inappropriate jokes or comments about women. ​
Source: Core Research for Women’s Aid, 2024.
### Action 1
#### Think about the kind of man you want to be​
Most men want to support gender equality, but the role models we’ve had in the past haven’t always reflected those values. Irish culture can put pressure on men to act tough or be the main provider, but you don’t have to follow those expectations. Instead, choose to be the man who stands for respect, kindness and fairness. Ask yourself: Are you living as the man you truly want to be, or the one society expects you to be?
### Action 2
#### Reflect on your own actions
Take a moment to reflect on your own actions. Have you ever laughed at a sexist joke or stayed quiet when something didn’t feel right? This isn’t about guilt – it’s about being honest with yourself and seeing where you can grow. If something feels off, take a step to learn, read or ask someone you trust for perspective.
### Action 3
#### Show strength by being open and real​
True strength isn’t about staying silent – it’s about being open. Talk about how you’re feeling, check in on a friend and build connections. Younger lads will take notice, and by showing it’s okay to talk, you can help break the cycle of isolation that often leads to harmful behaviours.​​
