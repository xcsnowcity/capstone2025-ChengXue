## Legal Structure and Charitable Status
Established in 1974, Women’s Aid is a company limited by guarantee (58035) and is a registered charity (Registered Charity Number 20012045, CHY6491).
We are fully compliant with the [Charities Regulator Governance Code](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/en/information-for-charities/charities-governance-code) – a guiding framework to ensure that charities are managed in an accountable, efficient and transparent way.
Here in Women’s Aid, we are fully committed to ensuring that this ethos is embedded in all aspects of our work and that we foster a culture of ethical integrity.
## Governance and Oversight
The charity is governed by its Constitution and is managed by a voluntary [Board of Directors](https://www.womensaid.ie/about-us/our-people/). The Board of Directors ensure that:
  * Good governance systems and processes are in place.
  * Women’s Aid is fully compliant with its legal and regulatory responsibilities.
  * Resources are managed responsibly.
  * A strategic plan is in place to achieve Women’s Aid’s mission and vision.
  * A risk management process is in place to effectively monitor and mitigate potential risks.


Day to day operational management is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, Sarah Benson, who is supported by the Senior Leadership Team.
The Board meet on ten occasions during the year and its work is supported by a number of committees including the:
  * Finance, Audit and HR Committee [(download Terms of Reference)](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2024/03/Finance-Audit-HR-Committee-TOR.pdf).
  * Governance and Risk Committee[ (download Terms of Reference)](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2024/03/Governance-and-Risk-Committee-TOR.pdf).
  * Strategic Planning Committee [(download Terms of Reference)](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2024/03/Strategic-Planning-Committee-TOR.pdf).


The expertise on the Board is drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds, experience and skills and their performance is supported by:
  * Board Induction Programme – a robust programme is in place for new Board members to ensure they have the necessary and appropriate information to make informed decisions.
  * Annual Board Evaluation – conducted to encourage and promote continuous improvement and identify any gaps.
  * Culture of Accountability and Transparency – all our Board members complete a Conflict of Interest Declaration and sign a Code of Conduct and a Confidentiality Agreement. Board members are expected to make a conflict of interest declaration prior to each Board meeting.


## Financial Reporting
The Board ensure that the Annual Report and Financial Statements comply with statutory requirements, the requirements of the company’s governing document and the provisions of [SORP (Statement of Recommended Practice for Charities](https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/media/4569/guidance-on-charities-sorp.pdf)) in the preparation, auditing and publishing of its Directors Report and Audited Financial Statements.
