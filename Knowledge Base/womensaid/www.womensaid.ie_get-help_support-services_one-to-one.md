## How can I access this service?
The One-to-One Support Service operates on an appointment only basis. Call us on the Women’s Aid 24hr National Freephone Helpline [1800 341 900](tel:1800341900) to make a booking.
## How can this service help me?
With the One-to-One Support Service you will get ongoing support and information on your options. This can include things like court accompaniment and safety planning. A Support Worker can advocate for you if needed.
## Who will I see?
You will meet a Women’s Aid Support Worker. All Support Workers are professional, understanding and experienced in managing situations like yours.
## Support at Court
Our support workers also provide court accompaniment to women engaging with the legal system because of domestic abuse.
**Reasons for accessing legal support include:**
  * Applying for a Safety, Protection, Emergency Barring Order, Interim Barring or Barring Order
  * Custody, Access and Maintenance Orders
  * Family Law Court Hearings relating to the above
  * Criminal hearings for breaches of Domestic Violence Orders by a partner or ex-partner


Before Court, your Support Workers will check if you are eligible for the order you are seeking and talk through any consequences of taking this action. They will explain Court procedures and help you to prepare any documents needed. They will also support you to plan your safety at this time. 
On the day, the Women’s Aid Support Worker will provide emotional support, clarify any legal terminology, inform you of any follow-up proceedings and options and identify safety measures for you and your children following the Court hearing. 
## How long will I use the service for?
You can use the service for as long as you need to. Women’s Aid Support Workers will work with you to make you as safe as possible. The length of time a woman uses this service depends on her needs and varies on a case-by-case basis.
