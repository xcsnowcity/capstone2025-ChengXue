# Standing together to tackle domestic abuse – Allianz and Women’s Aid announce new phase of partnership as abuse rates rise
  * **Partnership announcement comes as figures reveal there were more than 61,000 contacts relating to domestic abuse received by An Garda Síochána in 2024**


**Wednesday 22nd January 2025:** Today, Allianz announced a new phase of its partnership with Women’s Aid, which will be for a further three years. The announcement follows on from research* by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which revealed that the number of women who have been directly impacted by domestic abuse across the country has increased. 35% of women in Ireland, more than 1 in 3, have now experienced psychological, physical and/or sexual abuse from an intimate partner, showing just how many people are directly impacted by the issue. The shocking figure on domestic abuse in Ireland comes as figures from An Garda Síochána** reveal that in 2024, reports of domestic abuse increased by 9% to 61,000.
Over the next three years, Allianz will continue to provide both financial and non-financial support to Women’s Aid, including new educational campaigns that will be designed to start important conversations and raise awareness of Women’s Aid’s resources. Allianz will also continue to educate its workforce in Ireland, over half of which is made up of women, on recognising the signs of abuse, and what resources are available to support anyone who needs help.

**Commenting on the announcement, Phillip Gronemeyer, CEO of Allianz** , said: ‘As a business, we want to do everything we can to secure people’s futures and give courage to some of the strongest people of all. Partnering with such an important organisation as Women’s Aid has enabled us to stand alongside the increasing number of women across Ireland who have been subjected to domestic abuse.
While it is heartening that so many women have been empowered to call out abusive behaviour over these past three years of our partnership with Women’s Aid, we know there are so many more who are unable to seek help and support for their own individual reasons. In the years ahead, we aim to continue to shine a light on the societal issue of domestic abuse and help play our part in moving closer to a zero-tolerance society’.
**Sarah Benson, CEO of Women’s Aid,** added: ‘Allianz has been an incredible partner to us these past three years, starting lifesaving conversations and inspiring more women subjected to domestic abuse to seek our support. They have set an example that we hope more companies will follow in how organisations can bring about real, positive change for society.
2024 marked 50 years since Women’s Aid first started providing frontline support to victims-survivors of domestic abuse. As we head towards the next 50, we look forward to breaking more ground with Allianz and completely breaking the taboo associated with speaking up about domestic abuse in this country’.
