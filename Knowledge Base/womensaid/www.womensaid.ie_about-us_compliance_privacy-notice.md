These rights are only available in certain circumstances and may not be available in some cases. Women’s Aid takes the confidentiality of its service users very seriously and does not generally discuss any individual case with third parties. Due to this confidentiality and the nature of Women’s Aid work of working with women experiencing abuse, it is Women’s Aid policy, where we are entitled to do so under applicable law, not to grant data protection requests made by other individuals as a result of the possible risk to women who use our services.
If you proactively contact us regarding the recipient of our service, then we may inform the woman who avails of our service of this contact if it is in the interests of the woman to do so.
If you have any comments or queries please refer to our [Feedback Policy available on our website (PDF)](https://www.womensaid.ie/app/uploads/2022/06/womens_aid_feedback_policy_2019.pdf).
If you are not happy with the way we have used your information or addressed your rights, you have the right to make a complaint to the [Irish Data Protection Commission](https://www.dataprotection.ie/).
