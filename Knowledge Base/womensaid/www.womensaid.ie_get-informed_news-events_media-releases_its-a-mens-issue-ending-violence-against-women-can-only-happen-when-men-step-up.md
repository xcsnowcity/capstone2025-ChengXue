# “It’s a Men’s Issue” – Ending Violence against Women Can Only Happen When Men Step Up
**Thursday, 30 th June 2022, Dublin:** Today, Women’s Aid, in partnership with Trinity College Dublin, is hosting a public lecture on the topic of “Violence against Women is a Men’s Issue”. The main speaker is Dr Jackson Katz, a leading global figure in the growing movement of men working to end men’s violence against women. Women’s Aid is hosting the event to build understanding on the role that men have in tackling domestic abuse and all other forms of violence against women. At the event, Dr Katz will outline key opportunities and practical tools for engaging men and young men of all backgrounds in the prevention of sexual assault, relationship abuse, and other forms of gender-based violence. The gathering is timely because of the recent launch of the Government’s third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender based violence. Women’s Aid hopes that today’s event will encourage more men to become leaders and allies in the journey towards zero tolerance of violence against women.
Sarah Benson, CEO, Women’s Aid says:
“In Ireland, there continues to be a national focus on tackling violence against women. Rightly so. This issue has been brought into sharp focus because of the Covid-19 pandemic but also a number of high profile attacks and killings of women, including the shocking death of Ashling Murphy earlier this year. One in four women experience domestic abuse in Ireland. In a recent survey by Women’s Aid, we found that one in five young women had experienced abuse by an intimate partner before the age of 25. Over half of these young women experienced the abuse under the age of 18. Gender based violence is a scourge on Irish society and limits the potential of all women affected.”
Ms Benson continues:
“Some men today, subject too many women and girls to horrendous abuse and violence. This is a fact. However, it should not be ‘a fact of life’ for our young people. We have, within our grasp, a unique opportunity to really create a zero tolerance of violence and create an equal society for women and girls. Crucially, we need more male leaders across all sectors and strata in society to step up and become a strong voice to call out everyday sexism, misogyny and gender inequality.”
Speaking ahead of the event, Dr Jackson Katz says:
“Preventing violence against women is fundamentally a leadership issue for men at all levels of political power, institutional authority, and cultural influence. There are interconnections between men’s violence against women, other men, and themselves, all with an intersectional lens that links incidents of interpersonal abuse to larger institutional and societal forces, and the belief systems that underlie them. Our movement is critical in ending violence against women, men and children. Everyone.”
Sarah Benson outlines:
“We are delighted to host Dr Katz and hear more about the MVP programme, the first large-scale anti gender based violence program of its kind in the university and professional sports culture and all branches of the U.S. military. We have a lot to learn but we have to do it now as a matter of urgency. The Government’s latest national strategy, launched earlier this week, is an ambitious plan. It coincides with, and supports, our own mission. However, achieving zero tolerance of all forms of violence against women will only be possible when all men recognise they have a role to play and step up.”
Ms Benson concludes:
“Hosting this important event, in partnership with Trinity College Dublin is a part of Women’ Aid commitment to supporting and empowering everyone, and particularly men, into their leadership to work co-operatively together with women and other people to build a more equal and compassionate society where violence is not tolerated.”
