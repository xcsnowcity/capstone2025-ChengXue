  5. Recognising and Responding to Domestic Violence and Abuse in the Workplace


# Recognising and Responding to Domestic Violence and Abuse in the Workplace
### About this training
Women’s Aid’s half day online training programme is focused on recognising and responding to domestic abuse. This training is designed for key staff members of small organisations which are developing their workplace response to domestic abuse. Places are reserved for representatives of organisations with fewer than 150 employees.
### How this training is delivered
Training is delivered on Zoom. Each participant must have access to a private space, a good internet connection, a computer, or another device to take part in the training.
### Who is this training for?
**IMPORTANT: Places on this training are reserved for representatives of organisations with fewer than****150 employees****. We can only accommodate two people from the same organisation.**
Recommended participants are:
  * Those with a responsibility to open up the conversation or respond to disclosures of domestic abuse in the workplace (e.g. people managers, HR representatives, small business owners, workplace ‘champions’ of the issue, etc.)
  * Senior leaders, who are responsible for setting the tone regarding their organisation’s response to domestic abuse and approving related policy provisions


**Representatives of organisations with more than 150 employees are invited to develop their workplace response by availing of the Women’s Aid Employer Response to Domestic Abuse Training Package. Learn more and enquire here:**[**Support for Employers.**](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-training/support-for-employers/)
### How much does this training cost?
The fee for the training is €200.00 per person.
Please note that we can only accommodate two people from one organisation in one training, if you have more than two people please contact the Training Administrator by email: training@womensaid.ie.
### What will I gain from this training?
The training is framed around the **3 Rs – Recognise, Respond, and Refer.**
**R ecognise**
  * Dynamics of domestic abuse
  * Forms and tactics of abuse used by the perpetrator and the intention behind them
  * Impacts on the victim/survivor and their coping mechanisms
  * Indicators that may alert us a woman is experiencing domestic abuse


**R espond**
  * Learn victim-centred principles which should guide your response
  * Understand the barriers facing victim/survivors in seeking and accessing support
  * Learn how to safely support a disclosure


**R efer**
  * Increase knowledge about referral options to specialist domestic abuse services and what they can offer


Completing this training is just one aspect of the development of a wider organisational practice of responding to domestic violence and abuse. The training session will therefore conclude with recommendations and resources for the next steps participants can take to establish or improve their workplace response to domestic violence and abuse.
### Why should I do this training?
In 2023, the Government of Ireland introduced a legal requirement for employers to offer up to five days of paid leave over a period of 12 months to employees affected by domestic violence. In order to give meaningful effect to the legislation, it is recommended that employers embed domestic violence leave within a wider organisational response to domestic abuse. Training on the issue is pivotal to ensuring the workplace response is safe and effective.
Domestic violence and abuse has traditionally been considered a private family matter but businesses and organisations are increasingly becoming aware that it is an issue which directly impacts employees’ participation at work and the workplace itself. High prevalence of the issue means the cost of domestic abuse to companies can be considerable.
**Important:** Please note that the training may not be suitable for anyone currently experiencing, or who has recently experienced, domestic violence as the material may be distressing. If you have any questions or concerns about participating in the training, please feel free to contact us.
The training is designed to upskill those supporting people experiencing domestic violence. If you are experiencing domestic violence, or if you are concerned on behalf of someone else, please contact Women’s Aid 24hr National Freephone Helpline on 1800 341 900 or through the Instant Message Support Service.
