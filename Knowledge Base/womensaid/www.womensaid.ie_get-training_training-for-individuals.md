# Training for Individuals
Are you a professional, perhaps working at an agency, and are interested in learning more about how to support women subjected to domestic abuse? You may be interested in Women’s Aid training to improve your own professional practice as an individual.
This may be suitable for you if you work in a small organisation, are self-employed or if your organisation is not currently pursuing organisational training on domestic violence and abuse.
