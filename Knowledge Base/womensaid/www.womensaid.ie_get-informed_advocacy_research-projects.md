### [Domestic Violence, Custody and Access and the Irish Family Law System](https://www.womensaid.ie/get-informed/advocacy/research-projects/#collapse0)
Women’s Aid is carrying out research to explore the experiences of victims/survivors of domestic violence and abuse, including children, in custody and access proceedings in the Irish Family Law system.
This research is an independent, evidence-based 360-degree examination of how effectively custody and access proceedings, both exclusively or in intersection with other proceedings, systems and factors, responds to the safety and well-being requirements of victims/survivors of domestic abuse, including children.
This research project is being undertaken by [Trinity College Dublin, School of Social Work and Social Policy](https://www.tcd.ie/swsp/) and is supported by a Research Advisory Group comprised of a range of key stakeholders from relevant disciplines. Publication is expected by mid-2025.
