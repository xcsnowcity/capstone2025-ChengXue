# ‘When Love Turns to Lovebombing’: Women’s Aid launches Too Into You Podcast to help young people recognise healthy love and red flags
  * **Women’s Aid launches new Too Into You Podcast to teach young people about the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships.**
  * **In 2024, 19,900 people took the Relationship Quiz at toointoyou.ie to see if their relationship was healthy or not.**
  * **Women’s Aid launches four week long national Too Into You public awareness campaign for young people. The campaign aims to teach young women in particular about intimate relationship abuse.**


**Thursday 13th February, 2025:** Women’s Aid, a national organisation supporting women subjected to intimate relationship abuse, is launching their Too Into You Podcast — the first podcast of its kind in Ireland aimed at empowering young people to identify healthy relationships and spot the red flags of abuse.

Recent data from the  _Too Into You_ relationship quiz, which was taken by over 19,900 people in 2024, clearly shows that young people in Ireland are increasingly concerned about the health of their relationships. With **1 in 5 young women** in Ireland experiencing abuse from a current or former partner, there is an urgent need for clear, supportive conversations about what constitutes healthy love and what crosses the line into control and abuse.
“ _Too Into You_ is more than a podcast—it’s a platform for real conversations that help young people understand that love should lift you up, not hold you back,” said Mary Hayes, Project Coordinator of Too Into You. “By providing honest and expert insights, real-life stories, and practical tools, we hope to empower young people to make choices that prioritise their safety and well-being. We hope that the Too Into You podcast will help listeners recognise red flags early on and celebrate the signs of truly healthy relationships. We believe that by fostering these conversations, we can create a safer, more supportive future for everyone.”
Each episode of the  _Too Into You_ podcast will delve into topics ranging from coercive control and emotional abuse to understanding what genuine, respectful love should feel like. The series will feature candid discussions with experts, as well as personal narratives from influential voices such as content creator Keelin Moncrieff and survivors like Jody Duggan, who share their journeys to inspire and educate listeners.
“Being part of the  _Too Into You_ podcast has given me a voice to share my story,” says Jody Duggan, one of the featured guests on the series. “I hope that by speaking openly about my experience, I can help others spot the warning signs of abuse and recognise when someone is ‘too into you.’ I want young women to know that love should empower you, not confine you.”
The  _Too Into You_ podcast is a key component of Women’s Aid’s broader  _Too Into You_ Project, a national initiative dedicated to teaching young people the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships. This critical work equips young people with the knowledge to identify red flags, set healthy boundaries, and find support when they need it through Women’s Aid’s dedicated website for young people, toointoyou.ie.
The launch of the podcast will prompt the start of Women’s Aid’s four-week Too Into You campaign, which will run from 13th February to International Women’s Day, 8th March. The campaign aims to raise awareness amongst young people of relationship red flags and the supports provided for young people at toointoyou.ie.
Ms Hayes concludes: “Our earliest relationships shape us profoundly, and Women’s Aid believes every young person deserves a healthy, respectful, and fulfilling start. Yet with one in five young women in Ireland experiencing abuse by age 25, there is still much work to be done. It’s crucial that we equip young people with the tools to recognise warning signs of abuse and seek help when needed, while also promoting healthier behaviours as alternatives to jealousy, control, or dominance. We’re excited to launch the Too Into You Podcast to help us achieve this and we encourage everyone to share it widely with the young people in their lives.”
The  _Too Into You_ Podcast is available now on all major platforms, including Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Women’s Aid invites everyone to listen, share, and join the conversation on building relationships that empower rather than control.
