# Gift in Wills
Your legacy can help deliver zero tolerance for domestic violence and a safer future for generations of women in Ireland.
## A gift in your Will can end fear
If you are considering leaving a gift to Women’s Aid, thank you so much. Your legacy can help deliver zero tolerance for domestic violence. And a safer future for generations of women in Ireland. We need the help of generous supporters like you to achieve this.
> “When things finally became too much to bear, I set out on a journey of many small steps. Women’s Aid built those steps for me. They gave me a map of hope. They held my hand and helped me walk to freedom and safety” Kasia
## Why your legacy matters
Women’s Aid is driving a dynamic strategy entitled ‘An End To Fear’ with a simple and vital ambition – to make the single greatest impact on domestic violence in our history. You can be an important part of this.
Your powerful gift will transform the future for women and children. It will move us sooner to an Ireland where women no longer suffer in silence. Where they feel safer reporting abuse. Where quality services are available wherever and whenever needed. And where abusers suffer appropriate criminal consequences.
That’s what a gift in your will could make happen. That’s how you’ll be remembered.
**Someone who loved deeply.**
**Someone who changed the world.**
**You really can help to end fear.**
