Since 1996, Women’s Aid has run annual awareness campaigns and made resources available for local action to take place, we have held events outside the Dáil and brought national and international experts together to start conversations to tackle domestic violence and abuse in Ireland.
The campaign runs each year from 25th November (UN Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) to 10th December (International Human Rights Day).
This year Women’s Aid will raise awareness of violence against women including the **prevalence of domestic abuse in Irish society, how it impacts women during pregnancy and how employers can lead in addressing domestic abuse as a workplace issue.**
##  Women’s Aid UN Day For the Elimination of Violence against Women Webinar

Join us on the eve of the UN Day For the Elimination of Violence against Women as we officially launch a **new online resource hub** for employers to support the implementation of the Statutory Domestic Violence Leave, which commences on the 27th November 2023.

**Addressing Domestic Abuse – An Issue for Employers**
You will learn how businesses and organisations are increasingly becoming aware that domestic violence and abuse is an issue which directly impacts employees’ participation at work and the workplace itself. The cost of domestic abuse to companies can be considerable. Learn more about the support for employers to create an understanding and safe workplace environment for victims/survivors of domestic abuse.
