Anyone who may wish to report or discuss an incident of domestic or sexual violence can contact 112/999 or their [local Garda Station](https://www.garda.ie/en/Contact-Us/).
For child abuse incidents contact the dedicated phone line for the reporting of child sexual abuse on 1800 555 222. This confidential free-phone line is available on a 24-hour basis, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
An Garda Síochána encourages victims of domestic abuse to report any such incident at the earliest opportunity including incidents that have happened in the past.
## Calling An Garda Síochána
If you are in danger call the Gardaí on 999/112. When you call 999/112 uniformed Gardaí will arrive at your location in a marked patrol car. They will ensure that you are not in immediate danger. When you are safe, you will have time to discuss with the Gardaí exactly why you called.
## What happens when the Gardaí arrive
  * Gardaí will arrive and introduce themselves
  * They will speak to those involved separately and ascertain what occurred
  * They will get details of those involved and the relationships between them
  * Where there is a domestic abuse Order in place and that Order has been breached, the Gardaí will arrest the perpetrator
  * Where there is no domestic abuse Order in place and the Gardaí have grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed and they have a power of arrest, they will utilise that power of arrest
  * Gardaí will investigate all offences that have occurred
  * Gardaí will take a statement of complaint from the injured party
  * Gardaí may seize any item that is considered evidence for their investigation
  * Gardaí will supply details of relevant support services
  * Gardaí will follow up with the victim after the initial call


## Reporting domestic abuse
If you are not in immediate danger and you need advice or help, you can also visit your [local Garda Station](https://www.garda.ie/en/Contact-Us/Station-Directory/) and ask to speak with a Guard in private, where they might ask you some questions.
Following an Emergency Call or a Visit to a Garda Station you may be asked the following questions:
  * Full details of name and address and contact numbers
  * Details of any Court Orders that are in place
  * Who is being abused
  * Whether there are children present
  * Whether alcohol or drugs have been taken
  * Whether the perpetrator has access to any weapons
  * If there is a history of abuse
  * What the situation is now


There is no right or wrong answer to these questions. The Gardaí want to find out as much information as possible to ensure that you are safe and that you stay safe, [find out more](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime/domestic-abuse/domestic-abuse.html).
