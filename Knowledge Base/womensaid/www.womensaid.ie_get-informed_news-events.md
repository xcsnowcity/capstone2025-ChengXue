# News & Events
By engaging in media work we hope to reach as many women affected by domestic violence as we can. We also believe that domestic violence will only stop through increased understanding and awareness of the issue.
We believe that the media has a vital role to play in communicating to and educating people about the reality of domestic violence and the effects of domestic violence on both women and children in Irish society.
