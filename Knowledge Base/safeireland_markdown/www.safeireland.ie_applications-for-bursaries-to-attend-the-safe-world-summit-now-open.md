# Applications for bursaries to attend the Safe World Summit now open
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
Update: The application process for bursaries to the Safe World Summit is now closed. We are delighted to have been able to respond to over 100 requests to attend the Summit. If you have further queries please contact summit@safeireland.ie
**Are you a survivor, responder, supporter or activist who would like to attend the Safe World Summit but you cannot afford the ticket price?**
The Safe World Summit happening this October is a once in a lifetime event, designed to bring together thought leaders, innovators, change makers and warriors from across industries, social causes and life experiences to focus on ending violence against women.
We are working to make the Safe World Summit as accessible as possible to a wide audience. We are actively fundraising to make bursaries available to cover the ticket price for the many people who want to attend the full two-day event but are not able to afford to buy a ticket.
To apply for a bursary, please complete this [form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HVC9F5N).
Bursaries will be awarded subject to availability.
**The closing date for applications is 10th October at 5pm.**
Bursaries are available for those aged 26 and over, who are ordinarily resident in the Republic/Northern Ireland.
We are also working with SpunOut.ie to ensure a high participation of young people at the Safe World Summit. If you are aged between 16 – 25 and would like to attend the Summit please apply through SpunOut.ie who are taking applications. You can find more information [here](https://spunout.ie/news/article/safe-world-summit-2018).
Please note that the bursary will only cover the ticket cost to the two-day Summit. It does not include travel, accommodation or food costs.
