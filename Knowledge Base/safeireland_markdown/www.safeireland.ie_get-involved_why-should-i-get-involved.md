  * ## Why should I get involved?
![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/slider-img-1500x630-safe-people-1500x430.jpg)


**Domestic violence is everyone’s business.**
It is a deeply rooted problem that impacts on thousands of women, men and children in Ireland. Get involved and help make Ireland the safest country in the world.
## Why should I get involved?
### Deeply rooted
We understand that the root of all violence is what happens in the home. Our homes are not isolated islands, they are part of society and affected by culture. Within these, offenders are creating trauma and violence and these problems become deeply rooted in society. That is why we need to get involved.
### They are you
In Ireland, hundreds of thousands of women and children are living with the effects of domestic violence. They are our mothers, sisters and aunts. They are your doctor or the stranger sitting beside you on the bus. They might be you.
### Preventable
Together, we can break this cycle of violence. Together, we can make Ireland the safest country in the world for women and children. Domestic violence is totally preventable.
So, if we get involved, what can we do about it?
## Ways to get involved
### Listen and Learn
Take time to [learn more about violence and abuse](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/understanding-domestic-violence/what-is-domestic-violence/) and the impact it has on women and children. It will help us to recognise the signs of abuse.
Learn from some of the world’s biggest leaders, speakers, thinkers, advocates, activists, and artists as they gather in Dublin for the [Safe World Summit 2018](https://www.safeireland.ie/summit/). Hear them speak and share ideas, with the purpose of action towards a safer world for women and children.
### Speak out
Shame and stigma are the two biggest reasons why women don’t report physical and sexual abuse. Silence allows domestic violence to continue. So, let’s speak out. By speaking out about domestic violence, we help to lift the veil on this hidden and pervasive problem.
### Myths?
We need to challenge the argument that sexual and domestic violence is out of character, a one-off incident or just happens with a few drinks. These myths only help to maintain the culture of shame that surrounds domestic violence.
You can take action in a safe way. Here is how:
  * [What services are available for you?](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/what-types-of-support-are-available/)
  * [Support a friend](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/safety-information/supporting-a-friend/)
  * [Am I abusive?](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/understanding-domestic-violence/am-i-abusing-my-partner/)


### Campaign
We all have a role to play to help prevent domestic violence. You can help by sharing [our awareness campaigns](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-involved/our-campaigns/) with your local schools, college campuses, community groups, sports clubs or with your family, friends or colleagues.
