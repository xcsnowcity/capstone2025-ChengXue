# Two Amazing Nights of Music in Aid of Safe Ireland
in [Blog](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/blog/)
We are delighted to share news about two amazing nights of music happening this week in aid of Safe Ireland.
As part of the Other Voices Live, Courage series, Glen Hansard will be performing live from the National Library of Ireland at 8 pm on Thursday, 21st of May. 
We are honoured that Glen has chosen Safe Ireland as his nominated charity, with all funds raised going to our Covid-19 Emergency Fund. 
The event will be live-streamed on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShA2laONFb8), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OtherVoices/) and [RTE.ie](applewebdata://AE5BC66B-EAE3-4376-84A2-01B68DF90591/ww.rte.ie)
The second event, Couch Eile will take place from 7 pm on Saturday, 23rd of May 
Irish duo Drew Maitland and David Keogan will host a pop-up, global live streaming event, which will host a diverse range of talented musicians from around the world, all performing to raise awareness and funds for three charities _Safe Ireland,_ _Médecins sans Frontiéres Ireland (Doctors without Borders) and Men’s Aid_
The event will be live-streamed on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugfCsyLa4s) and [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/CouchEileLive/)
It has been truly heartening to see the number of creative initiatives and kind offers of support we have received in recent weeks from people who want to do something to help women and children living with domestic abuse during this critical time.
We are incredibly grateful to Glen Hansard, the Other Voices team and all at Couch Eile for their support. 
You can donate directly to our Emergency Covid-19 Fund [here](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-involved/donate/). So far, the fund has supported nearly 150 women and 300 children to find safety, providing practical but essential items like food, heating oil, utility bills, transport costs or materials and appliances needed for new accommodation. We expect that the demand on this fund will rise over the coming weeks as women and children continue to find the space and freedom to reach out for support.
