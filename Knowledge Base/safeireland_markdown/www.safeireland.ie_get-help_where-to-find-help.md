**There are 37 domestic abuse services located in towns right across Ireland. Services are free, confidential* and available to all women. You can contact the service that is most convenient for you.**
### All of our services are open and operational
Our services around the country are providing emotional support, counselling and advice, helping women and children to find safe accommodation, supporting them to access courts and make applications for domestic violence protection orders, for example. Our services are also providing professional advice to anyone who may be concerned about a family member or friend who may not be safe at this time.
All the domestic abuse services are listed below by county. Please click on the name of the service for further information about the full range of services they are able to provide.
_*All domestic abuse services have policies in-line with the Children First Guidelines. When you make contact with a service you will be made aware of the services policy in the case of disclosures about child abuse._
