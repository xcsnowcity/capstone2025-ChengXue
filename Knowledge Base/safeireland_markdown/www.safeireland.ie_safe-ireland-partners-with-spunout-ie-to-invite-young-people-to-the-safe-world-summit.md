# Safe Ireland partners with SpunOut.ie to invite young people to the Safe World Summit
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
Safe Ireland is delighted to partner with SpunOut.ie to invite young people from across the country to attend [The Safe World Summit](https://www.safeireland.ie/summit/). Together we believe it is possible to make our homes and communities free of gender based violence, but we need the help of young people to make this dream a reality.
If you are aged between 16-25 years old, living in Ireland, and would like to attend The Safe World Summit 2018, please click [here ](https://spunout.ie/news/article/safe-world-summit-2018)to apply through SpunOut.ie for a ticket to Summit.
Safe Ireland and SpunOut.ie hope you will join us for this global gathering of thought leaders, innovators, and status quo disruptors, so that together we can understand new ways to heal, build resilience and restore the balance of equality. If you have further questions or concerns please email hello@spunout.ie
