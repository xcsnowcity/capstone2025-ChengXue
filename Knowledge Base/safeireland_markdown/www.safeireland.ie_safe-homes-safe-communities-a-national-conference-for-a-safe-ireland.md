# Safe Homes Safe Communities – A National Conference for a Safe Ireland
in [Blog](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/blog/)
**Safe Ireland invites you to join us at our National Conference for a Safe Ireland, which will be taking place on the 25th of November 2019 in Westport, coinciding with International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.**
The underpinning theme of our conference is prevention and what we need to understand, learn and do if we are to create communities that are safe and free from violence.
Our morning session will look at the scale of the problem with thought-provoking and radical presentations on coercive control, its human impact and its shocking cost. We will then examine what is at the root of coercive control with a presentation of brand new research on Irish attitudes towards gender equality, roles and responsibilities, commissioned by Safe Ireland.
In the afternoon, we will look at what has to happen to develop a national prevention strategy, across areas like policing, health, community and education. Then, we will launch a new and exciting Safe Ireland strategy to make County Mayo a pilot site for real and measured change in the way we prevent and respond effectively to violence and abuse in our homes and in our communities. We believe that this strategy paves the way for a revolution in the safety of women and children in Ireland.
This National Conference for a Safe Ireland will bring together national and international experts, leaders and trailblazers, practitioners, policymakers, academics, funders and other stakeholders in the field of domestic violence reduction. It offers a unique opportunity for learning, creating change, collaboration, engagement, and being at the heart of the movement to end domestic violence.
**Confirmed speakers include:**
Lynn Rosenthal – the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women
Ryan Hart – Coercive Control Survivor and Activist
Davina James Hanman – Leading UK Coercive Control Expert
Detective Supt. Gordon McCreadie – Police Scotland’s National lead for Domestic Abuse, Forced Marriage, HBA and Stalking & Harassment
The full programme can be viewed [here. ](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/programme-A4-PRINT.pdf)
A certificate of attendance will be given towards CPD for any attendee who needs same.
