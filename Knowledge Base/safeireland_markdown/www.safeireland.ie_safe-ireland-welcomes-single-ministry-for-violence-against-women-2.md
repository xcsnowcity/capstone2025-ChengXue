# Safe Ireland Welcomes Single Ministry for Violence Against Women
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
### Safe Ireland warmly welcomed today’s announcement by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee that policy and services for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence will reside within one single ministry, with oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach.
The Minister, making the announcement today during Dáil Statements on Violence Against Women, confirmed that the Dept of Justice will now assume full responsibility for all policy and delivery of services for women and children experiencing all forms of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence.
Speaking in response to the announcement, CEO Mary McDermott stated that
> “This is a momentous political move forward and is the manifestation of the relentless campaign work of Safe Ireland and its member organisations at local level, along with other women’s advocacy groups, for many years. Safe Ireland welcomes this announcement with enthusiasm and we wish to acknowledge the goodwill engagement we experienced from both Minister O’Gorman and Minister McEntee to reach this negotiation”.
We also want to extend our sincerest thanks to all of the TDs across all political parties and none, who responded with openness, passion and commitment to our many representations over the past year, to the structural reform proposals set out in our No Going Back document published in March 2021.
> “We recognise that a single ministry in itself is not a solution to the extensive social problem of violence against women, but it is a crucial advancement towards bringing about the structural reform needed to achieve this end. The challenges ahead will be many and will require the creation of state-of-the-art intervention and prevention systems and services with 21st century expertise. This week Ireland reached a tipping-point of intolerance of the relentless violation of women’s safety, and it is incumbent on all of us to respect the power this social capital has for real and meaningful social change”.
About Safe Ireland Safe Ireland is a national development and co-ordination body with responsibility for Domestic Violence (DV) which over time has developed four distinct functions: investigating the causes and effects of DV; delivering frontline refuge and support services; developing guidelines for best practice in the delivery of local support services; and influencing national strategic policy. This is achieved by working directly with a range of public bodies; local independent frontline DV services; academic institutions; philanthropists; and corporate partners.
For further information on this statement please contact Miriam Kivlehan, Programme and Communications Manager
