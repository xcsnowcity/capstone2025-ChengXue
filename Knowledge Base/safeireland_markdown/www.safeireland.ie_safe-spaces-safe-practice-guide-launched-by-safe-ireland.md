# Safe Spaces Safe Practice Guide Launched by Safe Ireland
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
 _Safe Ireland_ has today launched a new [_Safe Practice_](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/SP-Web-Version.pdf) guide for Domestic Violence Professionals. The guide, which is funded by the Community Foundation of Ireland, RTE Does Comic Relief, the Government of Ireland, Tusla, Pobal and the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime has been developed as a tool for frontline domestic-abuse responders to enable them to support victims of domestic violence. The guide, which is the second in the _Safe Spaces_ series, was launched at a gathering of Safe Ireland Network Members in Athlone on 12th December 2023 with Airbnb supporting the event.
CEO Mary McDermott stated that
> Domestic, Sex, Gender and Sexuality-based Violence destroys our ability to form stable homes and communities and it stifles personal freedom and hope. This can only be prevented when we identify DSGBV correctly, respond with skill, and overcome fear, silence and shame. We hope the launch of the Safe Practice Guide today will support specialist DV responders, and through that work, enable communities across Ireland to prevent the subjection and murder of women and children.
The Practice Guide has been designed for specialist domestic violence professionals who work with victims of domestic abuse and coercive control. Its primary use is for frontline responders in _Domestic Violence Refuge and Support Services_ but is also designed as a resource for all professionals who encounter domestic violence through their work: Gardaí, doctors, nurses, social workers, teachers, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.
The _Safe Practice_ guide follows _Safe Place_ – a DV Refuge design guide which was published in December 2022. The _Safe Spaces_ series will be completed early next year with the publication of _Safe Community_.
The _Safe Spaces_ series (Safe Place, Safe Practice, Safe Community) aims to establish a domestic violence quality-standard paradigm for both the development of new services and the retrofit of existing facilities and operations. The model will serve as both a national standard for the development and commissioning of a national service delivery plan, as a blueprint for locally based groups to establish community-based capital/refuge projects or local support services, and to contribute to the work of Community Development in Ireland by addressing the issues of domestic violence and its impact in all communities.
