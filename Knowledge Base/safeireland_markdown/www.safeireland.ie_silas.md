## The Sílas
**The Safe Ireland Leadership Awards – or as we are calling them the SÍLAs are awards to recognise amazing people who we admire and believe have helped to make our homes, our communities and our world a safer and more equal place.**
The SÍLAs will be an annual event. It is our way of saying thanks to women and men who have shown courageous leadership, who have followed a vision and a passion, who have pushed out boundaries, spoken out against injustice, given us hope and raised our expectations that there is a better way to live and love.
In our inaugural year of the SÍLAs, we are recognising the careers, passions and dedication of some truly remarkable women.

### Dr. Edith Eva Eger
Dr. Edith Eva Eger was just a teenager in 1944 when she and her family were sent to Auschwitz. Her parents were sent to the gas chambers. Edith and her sister survived. Dr. Eger has had an amazing career as a prolific and best-selling author, clinical psychologist, public speaker, swing-dancing fan, and inspirational advocate for the power of hope and healing.

### Dr. Riane Eisler
Dr. Riane Eisler is a cultural historian, systems scientist, educator, attorney, speaker and author, whose work on cultural transformation has inspired scholars and social activists. She was the first to use the term domination culture to describe a system of top-down rankings ultimately backed up by fear or force - man over man, man over woman, race over race. Her alternative view of a partnership culture rooted in mutual respect is integral to the whole new world view needed to ensure equality and safety.

### Ailbhe Smyth
Ailbhe Smyth needs little introduction to an Irish audience. As an inspiring academic and long-time activist on feminist, LGBT and other social issues, there is hardly a high profile, life changing, progressive social change campaign that has taken place in Ireland over the past 30 years that has not benefited from Ailbhe’s energy, resilience, erudite observations, passion, respect and dignity. She is a national treasure.
