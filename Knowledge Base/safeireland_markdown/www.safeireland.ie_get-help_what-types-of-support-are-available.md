Domestic violence support services
There are 37 domestic violence support services right across Ireland who offer a range of these services to women and children experiencing domestic violence. [Find out more.](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/)
Refuge
A refuge is a safe place where women who are experiencing domestic violence can live while they decide what to do next. Women usually go to a refuge when they aren’t safe at home. There is no time limit for how long you can stay in a refuge. If you have children, you can take them with you to the refuge. Refuges are generally open 24 hours a day. There are 20 refuges across Ireland.
Details can be found on our [Where to find help](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/) page.
Helpline
A Helpline offers callers a confidential non‑judgmental listening service. You will be provided with information on your options and the range of services available to you.
A face-to-face meeting with a support worker may be necessary when dealing with issues, which are not practical to discuss on the phone. All contact with the you is kept strictly confidential*.
### Helplines:
There are many local services throughout the country that provide helplines. [Find a local helpline](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/)
_*All domestic violence services have policies in-line with the[Children First Guidelines](https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Publications/ChildrenFirst.pdf). Clients and callers are made aware of this in the case of disclosures about child abuse._
One-to-one support
This service gives you a chance to meet a trained and experienced worker in a safe and confidential setting. Support meetings are mainly by appointment and a worker will try to agree a time that suits you. At the meeting you can talk about your situation, get emotional support, get information and discuss options. The support worker will always be focused on your safety and well-being.
If you are not sure what you want to do, the worker will not put pressure on you to make a decision. You can take as much time as you need and can continue to meet with the worker until you no longer feel you need the support.

Court accompaniment
This service is available to women who are pursuing legal options through the court system. Your court accompaniment worker will go with you to court and provide you with emotional support at a time that can be very difficult.
Other accompaniment
Sometimes, the main support a woman needs is to be accompanied when she has meetings with state agencies. The main purpose of accompaniment is support, clarification and advocacy if it is requested.
Advocacy
Advocacy is direct representation on behalf of, and with women, to other agencies. While the this is about empowering women to take control of their lives, it is also recognised that there are times when you may feel unable to advocate on your own behalf.
Support workers will contact relevant staff in other agencies on your behalf. They will explain the seriousness of your situation and ask them for the response you need to increase your safety and welfare and that of your children.
Outreach
Many domestic violence services have an outreach service in place. If you have no access to transport, or for another reason you cannot get to the services, they will arrange to meet with you in a safe place.
Childcare and supports for children
A number of domestic violence services provide a childcare service, so that you are free to work or attend appointments etc. Staff are highly trained to work with children who have experienced, or witnessed, violence in the home.
Supported Housing
Supported transitional housing is a step between emergency refuge accommodation and permanent housing. Supported transitional housing is usually more long-term than refuge and women can still access other services.
Support groups
Support groups offer a safe and confidential space in which you can share your experience of domestic abuse with other women in similar situations. These groups are run by qualified facilitators with experience of working with women survivors of domestic abuse. [Contact a service near you](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/) for further information.
