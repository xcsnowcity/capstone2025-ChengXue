# Safe Ireland Welcomes the Collaboration with the Irish Pharmacy Union in the roll-out of the Nationwide Safe Pharmacy Initiative
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
#### Safe Ireland welcomes the collaboration with the Irish Pharmacy Union in the roll-out of the  _Safe Pharmacy_ initiative, which is a community response to support women who are suffering from domestic violence.
Participating pharmacies will provide a safe confidential space where a victim can contact a local support service or can reach out to An Garda Síochána for emergency support. Pharmacies are trusted locations and  _Safe Pharmacy_ is an example of the type of skilled community response necessary to facilitate pathways from violence for women and children. Priming competent trained personnel in local pharmacies to partner with specialist trained services in the locality, will contribute to the emergence and growth of safer communities into the future. The future of tackling domestic violence lies in community led responses to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This initiative provides women and children with a standardised, quality-assured, safe access-point across the entire country and Safe Ireland commends the IPU for its leadership in its response to the ongoing surge of violence against women.
The IPU have released a video in support of this initiative which his being launched at 11.00 am today [https://twitter.com/IrishPharmacy/status/1542780359594631168](https://url6.mailanyone.net/scanner?m=1o7ByT-000474-3N&d=3%7Cmail%2F90%2F1656663600%2F1o7ByT-000474-3N%7Cin6j%7C57e1b682%7C10394446%7C8603467%7C62BEAF99CCCE424438070F5D822E5D3A&s=eNyL0YJGoQAvdSPs3vX2I7RJZWQ&o=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FIrishPharmacy%2Fstatus%2F1542780359594631168)

**About Safe Ireland**
Safe Ireland is the national development and co-ordination body working to eradicate Domestic Violence (DV). We have four distinct functions: investigating the causes and effects of coercion and violence based on sex, gender, and sexuality, particularly against women and against children; delivering frontline refuge, support, and outreach services; developing best practice guidelines for skilled community-led domestic violence response; and influencing civil society and national strategic policy. This is achieved through our network of affiliated independent frontline DV services as well as working directly with local communities; professionals; public bodies; academic institutions; philanthropists; and corporate partners.
