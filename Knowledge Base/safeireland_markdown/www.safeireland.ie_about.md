### Our Patron

President Higgins addresses attendees at the joint ManUp and HeForShe Event
We are incredibly honoured that the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins is the Patron of our organisation. To mark International Women’s Day in 2016, the President co-hosted a HeForShe and ManUp Event in Áras an Uachtaráin at which he said:
> ‘All of society is flawed if gender violence is allowed to occur; is tolerated; and if an intolerable silence prevails around this grave issue.’
His interest in women’s rights and equality and commitment to addressing the issue of violence against women is truly commendable. To read more about the event click [here](http://www.president.ie/en/diary/details/president-hosts-a-reception-in-his-role-as-a-global-world-leader-of-un-wome).
