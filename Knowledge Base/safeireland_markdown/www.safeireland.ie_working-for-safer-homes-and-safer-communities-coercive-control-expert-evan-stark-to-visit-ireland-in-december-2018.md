# Working for Safer Homes and Safer Communities – Coercive Control Expert Evan Stark to Visit Ireland in December 2018
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
Safe Ireland is delighted to be hosting world renowned Professor Emeritus Evan Stark and other leading experts in domestic violence at a series of conferences, meetings and information sessions with professionals, survivors and advocates this December.
#### **Increasing understanding**
As part of a wider strategy to create safer homes and safer communities the public events will be a great opportunity to support professionals across disciplines to improve responses to domestic violence. Participants will be empowered with a greater understanding of what coercive control is while also strengthening their professional capacity to help recognise and respond more effectively to domestic violence. The events will also provide information relating to new measures in Irish legislation that are set to commence in 2019.
#### **Multidisciplinary Conferences around Ireland**
Safe Ireland is collaborating with a number of organisations to co-host a series of multidisciplinary conferences around Ireland. The conference ‘**Understanding and Responding to Coercive Control** ‘ with Professor Emeritus Evan Stark, leading UK domestic violence expert Davina James Hanman and Irish legal expert Caroline Counihan will take place in both Sligo (12th December) and Clare (14th December).
Professor Stark will also speak in Dublin at the _Strengthening Responses Conference_ being run by St. Patrick’s Mental Health Services in association with Safe Ireland.
