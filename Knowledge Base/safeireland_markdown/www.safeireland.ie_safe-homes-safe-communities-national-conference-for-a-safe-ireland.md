# Safe Homes, Safe Communities: National Conference for a Safe Ireland
On the 25th of November 2019, Safe Ireland hosted the Safe Homes, Safe Communities: National Conference for a Safe Ireland in Westport, coinciding with International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.
200 people from a range of professions and backgrounds gathered in Knockranny House Hotel to hear from a stellar line up of speakers as they shared their life experiences, their ideas and their hope for creating a safer Mayo.
During the conference we launched two new and exciting initiatives: [Safe as Mayo: A Vision Strategy to Make Mayo the Safest County](https://www.safeireland.ie/policy-publications/#dflip-df_7521/1/) and [Man Up West](https://www.manup.ie/), an inspiring, brave and pioneering campaign to harness the voices, talents, concerns and activism of men and boys in the West of Ireland to play their crucial role in helping change the face of domestic abuse and coercive control.
We also launched our [Quick Reference Guide to Coercive Control](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/coercive-control-leaflet-A6-folded-proof-v2.pdf) which has been designed to help explain what coercive control is, what signs to look out for and also to provide information on the Criminal Offence of Coercive Control.
This post includes access to all of the presentations and resources launched on the day and we will be adding videos of some of the presentations in the coming weeks.
