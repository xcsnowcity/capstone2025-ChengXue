# Go Purple Day 2022 Launch
in [Blog](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/blog/)
Safe Ireland is delighted to partner with An Garda Síochána to support the #GoPurple Domestic Violence Awareness Campaign 2022. The campaign was launched today by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee at Athlumney House, Navan, Co. Meath and Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail Damien English with Assistant Garda Commissioner Chief Superintendent David Sheahan also in attendance.
The initiative was created by Community Garda Stacey Looby, Athlone Garda Station to create national awareness of Domestic Violence and to consolidate community partnerships between Domestic Violence Services and An Garda Síochána.
#GoPurple will take place across the country on the 29th of April and we are calling on everyone to show their support by going purple in your home, workplace or community and by donating to your local domestic violence service.
Follow the Instagram event page @purpledvday and share your images using the #GoPurple hashtag on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
