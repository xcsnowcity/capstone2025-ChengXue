# Learn the **Red Flags** of Technology Facilitated Abuse
The **#RedFlagsAreAbuse** billboard campaign which runs from September 25th to October 8th, 2022, is designed to create awareness of noxious digital behaviour which are red flags for technology-facilitated abuse. The campaign focuses on three problematic red-flag behaviours:
**![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/red-flag-icon-01.png)Incessant contact:** More commonly known as _‘blowing up your phone’_ to keep tabs on you with an expectation of immediate or prompt reply.
**![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/red-flag-icon-02.png)Location-sharing:** Constant demands to share your location or remote tracking of your movements.
**![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/red-flag-icon-03.png)Financial Abuse:** Restricting your access to online money or making you unduly accountable for essential purchases.
Technologies and platforms that make our lives easier are increasingly being used by more and more people every day. Perpetrators of abuse have quickly learned to adopt these technologies to exert coercion and control over their partners which may be done directly and/or through their children.
The novel nature of technology means that norms around use are not yet culturally established and abusive behaviour may not be easily recognised or may be seen as acceptable. Technology-assisted abuse follows the norms of other forms of abuse and victims are often disbelieved or dismissed, or behaviour is often falsely blamed on poor personal choice.

  * Making fake profiles to harass you
  * Monitoring all your online activity
  * Checking your search history
  * Demanding you give them your passwords to your online accounts
  * Restricting access to your finances using technology
  * Accessing your personal accounts without your knowledge or consent
