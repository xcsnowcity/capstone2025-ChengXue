# Artists raise money for Safe Ireland Covid-19 Emergency Fund
in [Blog](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/blog/)
One of the things that this pandemic has highlighted is that we are all in this together – that the virus can only be suppressed if we work together to stop it from spreading. Domestic abuse and coercive control is no different. It also needs a strong community response if we are to end it.
We have been blown away by people’s generosity and willingness to help during this crisis. These acts of kindness are sending a strong message to women and children that they are not alone, even at this time of isolation.
We were incredibly grateful to see two wonderful Irish artists, Emma Langford and Noirin Lynch using their talents to raise funds for Safe Ireland.
Noirin Lynch, who works closely with the [NCCWN Clare Women’s Network ](https://www.facebook.com/ClareWomensNetwork/)wrote a beautiful song ‘Good People’ about the little things that are making a difference for us during this strange and unprecedented time.
Emma Langford, a singer/songwriter from Limerick so kindly decided to donate all proceeds from her song ‘Mariana’, a song with a strong message of love and hope to the Safe Ireland Emergency Fund. You can buy the digital track [here](https://emmalangfordmusic.bandcamp.com/track/mariana-2).
All donations at this critical time will be distributed through our 38 member services to provide immediate and practical needs to women and children, to re-home them when necessary and to help ensure that they have the vital resources they might need to be safe in their own homes.

If you would like to fundraise for Safe Ireland, we would love to hear from you. Please contact info@safeireland.ie
