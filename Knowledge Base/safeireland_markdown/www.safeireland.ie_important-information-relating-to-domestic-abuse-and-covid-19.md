You are here: [Home](https://www.safeireland.ie "Safe Ireland")1 / Important information relating to domestic abuse and Covid-19
![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/covid_19-1-1.jpg)
### All services are open and operating. Support is still here.
This is an important time for everyone to pull together to support those most in need while also limiting any opportunity for the virus to spread. However, we know that for women living with abusive partners that this may become an even more difficult time so we are asking people to be extra vigilant in looking out for friends, colleagues and family members.
In light of the Covid 19 emergency, we want to assure the public that the domestic violence services are still providing services across Ireland. Each service is putting in place its own contingency plan based on its capacity and local circumstances. Safe Ireland will maintain a national information service which will detail the services that are available on a daily basis.
If you have any concerns for your immediate safety please contact the Gardaí on 999 or if you need support please contact any of the free and confidential domestic violence services throughout Ireland, details can be found [here](https://www.safeireland.ie/get-help/where-to-find-help/). The national helpline operated by Women’s Aid is also available 24hours support on 1800 341900.
If you have concern for a family member or friend who is at risk of abuse and violence please contact a domestic violence service for guidance or if there is immediate risk please contact the Gardaí on 999.
If you have any concerns regarding the Covid 19 virus please follow the public guidance issued by the HSE. Please click [here](https://www2.hse.ie/coronavirus/).
Please click [here](http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/CFBD614F393A630880258494003A8B40?opendocument) for updates from the Court Service on Covid 19 related arrangements.
In order to help curtail the spread of Covid 19, Safe Ireland has cancelled all personal contact meetings, training and awareness campaigns until the Covid-19 contagion is fully contained.
