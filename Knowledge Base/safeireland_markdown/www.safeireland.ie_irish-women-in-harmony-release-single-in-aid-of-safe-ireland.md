# Irish Women in Harmony release single in aid of Safe Ireland
in [Blog](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/blog/)
Safe Ireland is delighted to be supported by Irish Women in Harmony, a collective of over 40 Irish female artists, who have come together to record ‘Dreams’ by the Cranberries.
All funds raised from this beautiful recording will go to the Safe Ireland Covid-19 Emergency Fund, which will be distributed through our 39 member services. It will be used directly to meet the needs of women and children fleeing violence and abuse in their homes.
In order to address the problem of domestic abuse we need a strong community response, and this amazing collaboration is exactly that. A community of talented Irish female artists coming together to send a powerful message to those living with domestic abuse – they are not alone.
You can stream the song on your favourite platform [here](https://orcd.co/iwihdreams), add it to your playlists/collections and request it on radio!
The video will premiere at 7pm on Thursday 18th of June and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv4MYqzg-P4&feature=youtu.be).
You can donate €4 by texting SAFE to 50300 or donate through PayPal [here](https://www.paypal.me/SAFEireland).
