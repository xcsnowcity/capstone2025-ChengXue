## 25% increase in cases and rising
In the first months of Covid 19, cases of domestic violence increased by an average of 25% across the country.
We have to respond to this issue like we have never done before.
Your donation will ensure that Safe Ireland can respond to the emerging and ever-changing needs of women and children coping with unimaginable levels of trauma in a post-Covid era.
It will help us progress with our work to actively reach into women, to raise awareness about the destructive impact of abuse and to let survivors know that expert support is available to them in their own communities. It will also support our work to radically overhaul the bigger social and political structures that women rely on so much for ongoing safety, protection and recovery.
Covid-19 didn’t cause domestic abuse. It exposed the frailties of our national response to its vulnerable victims.
At Safe Ireland, we have our pulse on the immediate, practical responses that women need now, but critically, we have our eye firmly fixed on transforming the way our country responds to victims of domestic abuse and coercive control and how we can prevent violence happening in the first place.
Your vital and generous support will help us protect more women and children from abuse. In a crisis and into the future.
