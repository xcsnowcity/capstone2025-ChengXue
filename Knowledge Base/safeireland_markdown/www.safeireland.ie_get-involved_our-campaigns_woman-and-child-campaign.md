**Every woman and child deserves to feel safe. Reaching out is hard but we are here to help**
As the Christmas lights are switched off and the crib is packed away for another year, we are turning the spotlight on the difficult issue of domestic violence, but more importantly, on what we can do together to make Ireland a safer place for women and children in 2023.
We have just spent the last few weeks celebrating Christmas. At the centre of our holiday is a mother and child. As a society, however, we are failing 1000s of women and children who live with coercive control and domestic abuse every day.
Christmas is extremely stressful and often dangerous. The days and weeks which follow it are the busiest for our affiliated domestic violence refuge and support services across the country.
Woman and Child, the campaign has been made possible with funding from [The Community Foundation for Ireland](https://www.communityfoundation.ie/) and [Irish Women in Harmony](https://irishwomeninharmony.bandcamp.com/).
**Here are four simple but powerful things we can do to be more aware about coercive control and domestic abuse.**
### 1. Watch Nollaig na mBan
our powerful, 1 minute film.
We have partnered with award winning director Marion Bergin to make Ireland’s first short film about coercive control. Please watch and share it.
### 2. Know More
about coercive control.
![](https://www.safeireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/coercive-control-brochure-300px.jpg)Coercive control is a crime. It is a persistent and deliberate pattern of behaviour by an abuser over a prolonged period of time designed to achieve obedience and fear. It does not have to be physical to be domestic abuse. Know the signs.
