# Domestic Violence & Child Protection Training for Practitioners
in [Press Releases](https://www.safeireland.ie/category/press-releases/)
**Safe Ireland are collaborating with Trinity College Dublin and Mason Hayes & Curran for a new Domestic Violence and Child Protection Training Course for Practitioners commencing 4th October 2021.**
Following the recent amendment to the Irish Constitution (Article 42A) and the introduction of a range of new Child Protection Legislation, such as the Children First Act 2015 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, Child Protection Practitioners have identified the need for further training to carry out their roles and responsibilities within the current legal framework.
In response to this, the School of Social Work and Social Policy at Trinity College Dublin in collaboration with Mason Hayes & Curran and Safe Ireland are pleased to announce a new ONLINE Continuing Professional Development (CPD) course in Legal Training for Child Protection and Welfare Practitioners. This four week online course, commencing on 4th October at a cost of €400 per person, is relevant to Allied Health Professionals within the scope of Child Protection and Welfare including Social Workers, Social Care Workers, Family Support Workers, Public Health Nurses and Gardaí. Participants of the course will be able to access relevant and up to date online learning materials at their convenience over a four week period from 4th October. The online course includes videos, interactive presentations, case examples, case law, and discussion. Deadline for applications [here](https://www.tcd.ie/swsp/short-courses/cpdlegal.php) before 24th September 2021.
