# Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) - Tusla Learning Event
Tusla – Child and Family Agency are bringing together key stakeholders in the Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) sector at a learning event to consider the results of the first ever mapping exercise of DSGBV services nationally. Speaking at the event is White House Advisor on Violence Against Women, Lynn Rosenthal.
Eibhlin Byrne, Tusla Executive Manager with responsibility for DSGBV, says: “For the first time an extensive survey has mapped the location and quantum of DSGBV services being delivered. There has never been a more fortuitous ‘coalition o f the possible’ which can deliver on a comprehensive, cohesive network of services: an Oireachtas Committee committed to prioritising the legislative framework required; a statutory organisation charged with oversight and committed to multi-agency working; services responding to community needs.
“At the centre and the clear priority - the men, women and children who have the right to live at home without fear. No child should live in fear at home. No child should call a refuge a home.”
Tusla – Child and Family Agency, established on 1 January 2014, took over responsibility for funding DSGBV services nationally. Since its establishment, Tusla has been conducting a review of the delivery of these services. Joan Mullan, DSGBV Programme Manager with Tusla, said:
“We are at the beginning of a different kind of journey, whereby our collective information, commitment and energy can be translated into a shared understanding that is greater than the sum of the parts.
“The establishment of Tusla offers the opportunity for us to work together to change how Ireland responds to the problem of DSGBV.”
