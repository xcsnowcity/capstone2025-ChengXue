# DSGBV
DSGBV stands for Domestic Sexual and Gender-based Violence, DSGBV includes any form of abuse – physical and non-physical (emotional, financial, and digital). Abuse can take many forms and most times victims are subjected to different forms of abuse from their perpetrators.
The term gender-based violence (GBV) highlights that – although violence can impact people of any gender - women and girls are disproportionally impacted by this type of violence. This type of violence and abuse is rooted in gender inequalities and this term is used to highlight that women and girls face higher risk of violence at their homes, communities and societies.
