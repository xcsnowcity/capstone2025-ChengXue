# Female Genital Mutilation
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined as the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or any practice that purposely changes or injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice is internationally recognised as a human rights violation against women and girls.
[Public information about FGM](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/female-genital-mutilation/)
[The Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 (irishstatutebook.ie)](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/11/enacted/en/html) makes it a criminal offence to remove a girl from the state to mutilate her genitals.
For more information about FGM and the law, please check out this [AkiDwA leaflet (akidwa.ie)](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/11/enacted/en/html).
The level of FGM continues to increase in Ireland. While it is difficult to give exact figures, in 2017 AkiDwA estimated that 5,790 women and girls living in Ireland had undergone FGM, based on 2016 data collected by the CSO.
Health professionals working in Ireland must understand and respond to this issue.
Women and girls who have undergone this mutilation may present in various health-care settings.
To learn more, please read the third edition of [Female Genital Mutilation Information for Health-Care Professionals Working in Ireland 2021 (PDF, size, 32 pages)](https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/socialinclusion/domestic-violence/fgm-handbook-3rd-edition-2021.pdf).
