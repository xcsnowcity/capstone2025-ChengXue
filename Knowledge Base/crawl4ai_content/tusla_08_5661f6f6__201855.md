# Statement in relation to funding for the sexual and domestic violence sector
In 2014, Tusla undertook a comprehensive review of the sexual and domestic violence sector, which provided a national picture of services provision for the first time. Following this review, the Agency has developed a strategy for putting the domestic and sexual violence sector on a sustainable footing.
Tusla’s key priority will be to ensure that the needs of victims of sexual violence are being met in the best way possible. Funding to organisations providing direct counselling and support services to those who have experienced sexual violence was €4 million in 2014. This level of funding has been maintained in 2015. Moreover, Tusla will be making an additional investment of €500K in dedicated resources as part of its response to issues of sexual violence. The 2015 budget has been directed towards front-line services and ensuring that no potential service user is disadvantaged because of geography. The decision to cease the funding to RCNI is dictated by the need to achieve the best use of limited available resources. RCNI does not provide direct services to victims.
Following a review of the RCNI database, the conclusion was reached that it does not meet Tusla requirements into the future as RCNI did not produce a comprehensive dataset from all sexual violence support services. Data from the two largest services, Dublin and Cork, was not included in the dataset. In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services’ sectors.
Commenting Fred McBride Chief Operations Officer said: “As Ireland readies itself for ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), Tusla is developing a comprehensive co-ordinated approach to service provision and to collecting high quality data to demonstrate that Ireland is meeting these agreements.”
